From Type {III} pneumococci a biologically active fraction has been isolated in highly purified form which in exceedingly minute amounts is capable under appropriate cultural conditions of inducing the transformation of unencapsulated R variants of Pneumococcus Type {II} into fully encapsulated cells of the same specific type as that of the heat-killed microorganisms from which the inducing material was recovered.2. Methods for the isolation and purification of the active transforming material are described.3. The data obtained by chemical, enzymatic, and serological analyses together with the results of preliminary studies by electrophoresis, ultracentrifugation, and ultraviolet spectroscopy indicate that, within the limits of the methods, the active fraction contains no demonstrable protein, unbound lipid, or serologically reactive polysaccharide and consists principally, if not solely, of a highly polymerized, viscous form of desoxyribonucleic acid.4. Evidence is presented that the chemically induced alterations in cellular structure and function are predictable, type-specific, and transmissible in series. The various hypotheses that have been advanced concerning the nature of these changes are reviewed.",

	abstract = "1. Osmotic shock disrupts particles of phage T2 into material containing nearly all the phage sulfur in a form precipitable by antiphage serum, and capable of specific adsorption to bacteria. It releases into solution nearly all the phage {DNA} in a form not precipitable by antiserum and not adsorbable to bacteria. The sulfur-containing protein of the phage particle evidently makes up a membrane that protects the phage {DNA} from {DNase,} comprises the sole or principal antigenic material, and is responsible for attachment of the virus to bacteria.2. Adsorption of T2 to heat-killed bacteria, and heating or alternate freezing and thawing of infected cells, sensitize the {DNA} of the adsorbed phage to {DNase.} These treatments have little or no sensitizing effect on unadsorbed phage. Neither heating nor freezing and thawing releases the phage {DNA} from infected cells, although other cell constituents can be extracted by these methods. These facts suggest that the phage {DNA} forms part of an organized intracellular structure throughout the period of phage growth.3. Adsorption of phage T2 to bacterial debris causes part of the phage {DNA} to appear in solution, leaving the phage sulfur attached to the debris. Another part of the phage {DNA,} corresponding roughly to the remaining half of the {DNA} of the inactivated phage, remains attached to the debris but can be separated from it by {DNase.} Phage T4 behaves similarly, although the two phages can be shown to attach to different combining sites. The inactivation of phage by bacterial debris is evidently accompanied by the rupture of the viral membrane.4. Suspensions of infected cells agitated in a Waring blendor release 75 per cent of the phage sulfur and only 15 per cent of the phage phosphorus to the solution as a result of the applied shearing force. The cells remain capable of yielding phage progeny.5. The facts stated show that most of the phage sulfur remains at the cell surface and most of the phage {DNA} enters the cell on infection. Whether sulfur-free material other than {DNA} enters the cell has not been determined. The properties of the sulfur-containing residue identify it as essentially unchanged membranes of the phage particles. All types of evidence show that the passage of phage {DNA} into the cell occurs in non-nutrient medium under conditions in which other known steps in viral growth do not occur.6. The phage progeny yielded by bacteria infected with phage labeled with radioactive sulfur contain less than 1 per cent of the parental radioactivity. The progeny of phage particles labeled with radioactive phosphorus contain 30 per cent or more of the parental phosphorus.7. Phage inactivated by dilute formaldehyde is capable of adsorbing to bacteria, but does not release its {DNA} to the cell. This shows that the interaction between phage and bacterium resulting in release of the phage {DNA} from its protective membrane depends on labile components of the phage particle. By contrast, the components of the bacterium essential to this interaction are remarkably stable. The nature of the interaction is otherwise unknown.8. The sulfur-containing protein of resting phage particles is confined to a protective coat that is responsible for the adsorption to bacteria, and functions as an instrument for the injection of the phage {DNA} into the cell. This protein probably has no function in the growth of intracellular phage. The {DNA} has some function. Further chemical inferences should not be drawn from the experiments presented.",

We show how these thermodynamic data can be used to calculate the stability and predict the temperature-dependent behavior of any {DNA} duplex structure from knowledge of its base sequence. We illustrate our method of calculation by using the nearest-neighbor data to predict transition enthalpies and free energies for a series of {DNA} oligomers. These predicted values are in excellent agreement with the corresponding values determined experimentally. This agreement demonstrates that a {DNA} duplex structure thermodynamically can be considered to be the sum of its nearest-neighbor interactions. Armed with this knowledge and the nearest-neighbor thermodynamic data reported here, scientists now will be able to predict the stability (delta G degree) and the melting behavior (delta H degree) of any {DNA} duplex structure from inspection of its primary sequence. This capability should prove valuable in numerous applications, such as predicting the stability of a probe-gene complex; selecting optimal conditions for a hybridization experiment; deciding on the minimum length of a probe; predicting the influence of a specific transversion or transition on the stability of an affected {DNA} region; and predicting the relative stabilities of local domains within a {DNA} duplex.",

In recent years, the crystal structures of a number of topoisomerase fragments, representing nearly all the known classes of enzymes, have been solved. These structures provide remarkable insights into the mechanisms of these enzymes and complement previous conclusions based on biochemical analyses. Surprisingly, despite little or no sequence homology, both type IA and type ITA topoisomerases from prokaryotes and the type IIA enzymes from eukaryotes share structural folds that appear to reflect functional motifs within critical regions of the enzymes. The type IB enzymes are structurally distinct from all other known topoisomerases but are similar to a class of enzymes referred to as tyrosine recombinases. The structural themes common to all topoisomerases include hinged clamps that open and close to bind DNA, the presence of DNA binding cavities for temporary storage of DNA segments, and the coupling of protein conformational changes to DNA rotation or DNA movement. For the type II topoisomerases, the binding and hydrolysis of ATP further modulate conformational changes in the enzymes to effect changes in DNA topology.",

Common features involve base-stacking and pairing of complementary bases via H-bonded interactions, although a wide variety of pairing motifs are found in higher-order structures. Another property is the marked flexibility of nucleic acids reflected in their solution behaviour, thermodynamic stability and interactions with proteins and small ligand molecules. The electrostatic properties of a nucleic acid and its ability to pack into high-order structure(s) are largely determined by the anionic phosphodiester backbone. This feature is particularly evident for triple-helical assemblies, where there is close proximity between phosphates and intrinsic thermodynamic stability is strongly influenced by ionic strength. Structural stabilisation of parallel triplexes can also be modulated by the presence of positive charge, achieved through either N3-protonation of cytosine bases or the deliberate incorporation of charged residues into the third strand. Salt effects are also pronounced in four-stranded structures such as the i-motif and G-tetraplex (“quadruplex”) assemblies; indeed, different structures are produced for the latter depending on the nature of the associated cation. High-order nucleic acid structures are currently a focus of intense interest in antisense and antigene strategies toward novel chemotherapeutic agents.

The movement of both monovalent ions remains diffusive in the presence of {DNA.} Ions sample the complete space available during the simulation time, although individual ions sample only about one-third of the simulation box. Ions preferentially sample electronegative sites around {DNA,} but direct binding to {DNA} bases remains a rather rare event, with highest site occupancy values of {\textless}13\%. The location of direct binding sites depends greatly on the nature of the counterion. While Na+ binding in both grooves is strongly sequence-dependent with the preferred binding site in the minor groove, K+ mainly visits the major groove and binds close to the centre of the oligomer. The electrostatic potential of an average {DNA} structure therefore cannot account for the ability of a site to bind a given cation; other factors must also play a role. An extensive analysis of the influence of counterions on {DNA} conformation showed no evidence of minor groove narrowing upon ion binding. A significant difference between the conformations of the double helix in the different simulations can be attributed to extensive {alpha}/{gamma} transitions in the phosphate backbone during the simulation with Na+. These transitions, with lifetimes over tens of nanoseconds, however, appear to be correlated with ion binding to phosphates. The ion-specific conformational properties of {DNA,} hitherto largely overlooked, may play an important role in {DNA} recognition and binding.",

With respect to the electrostatic descriptions, two different force fields are studied: a traditional description based on atomic point charges and a polarizable force field. With respect to the cell environment, the difference between crystal and solution environments is emphasized, as well as the structural importance of divalent ions. By imposing the correct experimental unit cell environment, an initial configuration with two ideal B-DNA duplexes in the unit cell is shown to converge to the crystallographic structure. This convergence is measured by the appearance of sequence-dependent features that very closely resemble the crystallographic ones as well as by the decay of the all-atom root-mean-squared coordinates deviations (RMSD) with respect to the crystallographic structure. Given the appropriate crystallographic constraints, this is the first example of multiple nanosecond molecular dynamics trajectory that shows an ideal B-DNA model converging to an experimental structure, with a significant decay of RMSD.",

The structure of this 22 nt sequence in the presence of K+ has drawn intense interest as the intracellular K+ concentration is greater than that of Na+. However, the question of the type of structure for the 22 nt telomeric sequence in K+ solution remains open. In this study, we substituted the Gs in the sequence with 8-bromoguanine and examined the resultant structures and thermal stabilities by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The results suggest that the 22 nt in K+ solution exists as a mixture of mixed-parallel/antiparallet and chair-type G-quadruplex. To date, the exact structure of human telomeric G-quadruplex in K+ solution is extremely controversial.

The three {TTA} loop segments adopt different conformations, with the first {TTA} assuming a double-chain-reversal loop conformation, and the second and third {TTA} assuming lateral loop conformations. The {NMR} structure is very well defined, including the three {TTA} loops and the two flanking sequences at 5'- and 3'-ends. Our study indicates that the three loop regions interact with the core G-tetrads in a specific way that defines and stabilizes the unique human telomeric G-quadruplex structure in K+. Significantly, a novel adenine triple platform is formed with three naturally occurring adenine residues, A21, A3 and A9, capping the top tetrad of the hybrid-type telomeric G-quadruplex.

Nevertheless, the presence of signature G-rich motifs in the eukaryotic genome, and the plethora of proteins that bind to, modify or resolve this nucleic acid structure in vitro have provided circumstantial evidence for its physiological relevance. More recently, direct visualisation of G-quadruplex DNA at native telomeres was achieved, bolstering the evidence for its existence in the cell. Furthermore, G-quadruplex folded telomeric DNA has been found to perturb telomere function and to impede the action of telomerase, an enzyme overexpressed in > 85\% of human cancers, hence opening up a novel avenue for cancer therapy in the form of G-quadruplex stabilising agents.",

The review highlights recent solution {NMR-based} G-quadruplex structures formed by the four-repeat human telomere in K+ solution and the guanine-rich strands of c-myc, c-kit and variant bcl-2 oncogenic promoters, as well as a bimolecular G-quadruplex that targets {HIV-1} integrase. Such structure determinations have helped to identify unanticipated scaffolds such as interlocked G-quadruplexes, as well as novel topologies represented by double-chain-reversal and V-shaped loops, triads, mixed tetrads, adenine-mediated pentads and hexads and snap-back G-tetrad alignments. The review also highlights the recent identification of guanine-rich sequences positioned adjacent to translation start sites in 5'-untranslated regions {(5'-UTRs)} of {RNA} oncogenic sequences. The activity of the enzyme telomerase, which maintains telomere length, can be negatively regulated through G-quadruplex formation at telomeric ends.

Techniques that are commonly applied to the determination of the structure, stability and folding are discussed in terms of information content and limitations. Quadruplex structures fold and unfold comparatively slowly, and {DNA} unwinding events associated with transcription and replication may be operating far from equilibrium.
