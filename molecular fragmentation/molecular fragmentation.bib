A general and natural choice is to share the charge density at each point among the several atoms in proportion to their free-atom densities at the corresponding distances from the nuclei. This prescription yields well-localized bonded-atom distributions each of which closely resembles the molecular density in its vicinity. Integration of the atomic deformation densities - bonded minus free atoms - defines net atomic charges and mull:ipole moments which concisely summarize the molecular charge reorganization. ]?hey permit calculation of the external electrostatic potential and of the interaction energy between molecules or between parts of the same molecule. Sample results for several molecules indicate a high transferability of net atomic charges and moments.",

	abstract = "The theory of atoms in molecules defines an atom and the average values of its properties. The intersection of an atomic surface, as defined by a property of the charge density, with a particular envelope of the charge density defines the volume of an atom in a molecule. The value of the density envelope used to bound the “open” portion of an atomic region can be chosen on the basis of comparison with measured properties. The nature of the results are, in any event, independent of the choice for envelopes which contain over 96\% of the total electronic charge and lie within the usual range of van der Waals contact distances. It is shown that the volumes of methyl and methylene groups in normal hydrocarbons are transferable properties, as are their charge distributions, populations, and energies. The volume of a carbon atom subject to steric crowding is found to decrease as its stability and electron population increase. This behavior is opposite to that found for a carbon atom in a system with geometric strain as found in cyclic and bicyclic molecules. The stability, population, and volume of a carbon atom all undergo parallel increases as the atom is subjected to an increasing degree of geometric strain. The volumes of the bridgehead carbon atoms in bicyclo[ l.l.O]butane and [ l.l.l]propellane are 1.2 and 1.5 times, respectively, the volume of a methyl carbon atom. As anticipated on the basis of the orbital model, an increase in geometric strain is correlated with an increase in s character and thus one finds the electron population, stability, and volume of a carbon atom to undergo the same parallel increases in value through the series ethane, ethylene, acetylene. As a first step in the investigation of how atoms fit together, the changes in the atomic volumes accompanying the formation of a hydrogen bond are determined. The changes in volume are correlated with the changes in the atomic populations and energies for the formation of homo and hetero dimers of water and ammonia and their protonated species.",

The dipole moment is given by a sum over the net charge and first moment of every atom in a molecule. The first term leads to a charge transfer cotnribution $\mu\_c$, the second to an atomic polarization contribution $\mu\_a$. It is shown that both terms are, in general, of equal importnace in determining both the static molecular dipole moments and the moment induced by a nuclear dispalcement. Models which imploy only point charges and corresponding bond moments which follow rigidly the nuclear framework, i.e., models which approximate $\mu\_c$ and ignore $\mu\_a$, are shown to lead to results that are incompatible with the cahnges that are found to occur in a molecualr charge dusturbution during a nuclear vibration. The dipole moment is shown to be another group property that is transferable between molecules in the normal hydrocarbons. This property, along with the net charge, the energy, the correlation energy (expressed as a functional fo the charge density), and the atomic volumes are transferable for methyl and methylene groups because of a corresponding transferability of the distribution of charge over the basins of the atoms in these groups up to their surfaces of zero flux in the gradient vector of the charge density. Trnassferability of group properties is not a result of the trnasferability of individual orbitals or geminals, which necessarily have tails lying outside of the group in question. Atoms have not tails and their energy, as is known from experiment, can in certain instances be transferred between systems with changes of less thatn 1 kcal/mol. The properties of atoms in molecules can be determined experimentally and quantum mechanics predicts these properties, just as it predicts the properties of a total system.",

The calculations are performed through the use of coupled-perturbed Hartree-Fock theory. An applied field polarized the atomic charge distirbutions and induces a transfer of charge between them. The resulting changes in the dipole moment per unit applied field determine the corresponding contributions to the polarizability. In general, the component of the polarizability along the internuclear axis in a linear molecuels or in the direction of a chain of bonds in a nonlinear polyatomic molecule, exceeds the perpendicular component because of the transfer of electronic charge between the two ends of the molecules, between the methyl groups in ethane, and between the methylene groups in ethene, for example. Atoms shielded from an applied field, carbon in methane for example, polarize in a direction counter to that of the applied field, responding instead to the opposing field created by the transfer of charge between the exterior atoms. The same behavior is found in vibrationally induced polarizations of a molecualr charge distribution. The extent of atomic polarization and of interatomic charge transfer caused by an external field are readily related to known properties of the atomic charge distributions and the corresponding contributions to the polarizability may be understood and predicted. The mean molecular polarizability and its group contributions are found to be lienarly proprtional to the corresponding sum of atomic volumes, making possible the preditction of molecular polarizabilities from tabulated atomic volumes as determined by the theory of atoms in molecules.",

The surface component is obtained as a consequenceof the.atomic hypervirial theorem defining the average of the velocity operator. Magnetic properties are determined by the observableelectron current density, and the atomic behavior of this field has been correlated with corresponding behavior of the electron density. Thus the importance of the magnetization within an atomic basin relative to the flux in current through its interatomic surfaces parallels the extent to which the electron density is localized within the individual atomic basins. For example, 77\% of the pronounced anisotropy in benzene arises from the flux in current through the interatomic surfaces of the ring atoms induced by a field applied perpendicular to the ring surface. The methyl and methylene group contributions to $\bar{\chi}$ are found to be transferable in the homologous seriesof hydrocarbons and to equal Pascal’s group increments within experimental error.",

The quantum pressure is determined by the virial of the force resulting from the electronic momentum ﬂux through the surface of the open system. A scaling procedure is used to demonstrate that the expectation value of the pressure–volume product of a proper open system is proportional to its surface virial. Previous work, in analogy with the classical virial theorem for a contained system, incorrectly relates the pressure to the external forces of constraint acting on a closed system. A neon vise consisting of a chain of three, four or ﬁve hydrogen molecules compressed between two neon atoms is used to introduce the quantum deﬁnition of pressure and study its effect on the mechanical properties of an atom and on the topology of the electron density. Pressures approaching 160 GPa have been calculated for the vise. The topology of the electron density and the homeomorphism it exhibits with the virial ﬁeld are found to be invariant to an increase in pressure, the electron density accumulating to an ever increasing extent between all pairs of nuclei which serve as the sole attractors. The virial of the Ehrenfest force acting on the surface of a compressed molecule provides a measure of the increase in the electronic kinetic energy resulting from the applied pressure. The effects of pressure on the intra- and intermolecular bonding are discussed in terms of pressure-induced changes in the electron density and in the mechanical properties of the atoms.",

Two sets of compounds were chosen to represent the different characteristics of the {SO2} heterocycles studied: simpler five-member heterocycles and {SO2} small derivatives. These molecules were optimized at the {HF/6-31G*} level and their energy evaluated by a punctual calculation {MP2/6-31G*//HF/6-31G*.} The dipole moments for these molecules were obtained by using all the methods previously mentioned and compared with the {SCF,} {MP2,} and experimental dipole moments. The influence on the charges of some atoms by changing the electronegativity of neighboring atoms has also been investigated for these compounds.

The derivation of the dressed property density, whose averaging over an atomic basin yields the atomic contribution to a given oscillator strength, is achieved through the development of perturbation theory for an open system. A dressed density describes the local contribution resulting from the interaction of a single electron at some position r, as determined by the relevant observable, averaged over the motions of all of the remaining particles in the system. In the present work, the transition probability density expressed in terms of the relevant transition density, yields a local measure of the associated oscillator strength resulting from the interaction of the entire molecule with a radiation ﬁeld. The deﬁnition of the atomic contributions to the oscillator strength enables one to determine the extent to which a given electronic or vibrational transition is spatially localized to a given atom or functional group. The concepts introduced in this article are applied to the Rydberg-type transitions observed in the electronic excitation of a nonbonding electron in formaldehyde and ammonia. The atomic partitioning of the molecular density distribution and of the molecular properties by surfaces of zero ﬂux in the gradient vector ﬁeld of the electron density, the boundary condition deﬁning the physics of a proper open system, is found to apply to the density distributions of the excited, Rydberg states.",

The observation of “experimental group additivty” requires that in addition to the properties of the groups being additive, the group and its properties be transferable from one molecule to another, different molecule. It is shown that such transferability of a group and its properties is in general, only apparent, being the result of compensatory transferability wherein the changes in the properties of one group are compensated for by equal but opposite changes in the properties of the adjoining group. These compensating changes are in some cases vanishingly small, but even when the energy changes are in excess of 20 kcal/mol, the experimental heat of formation is still predicted to be additive to within 0.1 kcal/mol. The operation of compensatory transferability is illustrated for the linear homologous series of hydrocarbons and polysilanes and for the formation of pyridine from fragments of benzene and pyrazine. The properties considered are the energy and the delocalization of the electrons, the former determined by the one-electron density matrix and the latter by the pair density. It is shown that the transferability of the degree of localization of the electrons to a given group, a property of the pair density, is a result of the conservation of the delocalization of its electrons over the remaining groups in the molecule. The results presented here emphasize the important observation that all the properties of a proper open systemsa functional groupswhether determined by the first-order density matrix, the pair density, or field-induced charge and current densities, are all functionally related to its form in real space, that is, to its distribution of charge.",

A range of interactions is considered: from closed-shell with and without charge transfer, through polar-shared, to equally shared interactions. The changes in the density are monitored in terms of the properties of the density at the bond critical point and the shape of the interatomic surface. The effect of these changes on the properties of the atoms defined as proper open systems is determined. The harpoon mechanism operative in the formation of {LiF} is found to exert dramatic effects on the electron density and on the atomic and molecular properties. The virial and the Ehrenfest force theorems in their molecular, atomic, and local forms, together with the {HellmannFeynman} theorem, provide an understanding of the similarities and differences in the bonding resulting from closed-shell, shared, and polar interactions. The effect of the long-range dispersion forces on the electron density and the resulting changes in the kinetic and potential energies, the former decreasing and the latter increasing on the initial approach of the atoms, are investigated. In addition to the changes in the total energy and its kinetic and potential energy components as a function of the internuclear separation R, the atomic contributions to these quantities are also reported. The atomic Ehrenfest force is the force acting on the electron density in an atomic basin and the one measured in an atomic force microscope. It is shown to change from an intially attractive interaction, to a repulsive one at a separation slightly greater than Re where the {HellmannFeynman} forces on the nuclei vanish.",

The cells are defined as bounded regions of real space whose properties are described by the physics of a proper open system, a description that applies to any system regardless of the nature of the interactions between the atoms. This approach necessarily leads to the inclusion of a contribution to the polarization arising from the transfer of charge across the boundary of a cell, in addition to that from the cell's internal polarization, thereby correcting the textbook description of polarization that considers only the latter contribution.

An atomic charge is measurable and it, together with its change, contributes to numerous measurable properties: to all molecular moments, to molecular polarizability, to intensities of electronic, infrared, and Raman absorption intensities, and to the polarization of a dielectric. The properties resulting from an applied magnetic field parallel those induced by an electric field, with the induced atomic charge being replaced by the atomic current. The phenomena of polarization and magnetization, permanent or induced, have a common physical basis when described in terms of the physics of an open system, all expressions exhibiting a single underlying structure in terms of their atomic contributions. The paper points out that this physics and the appeal the experiment it affords are lost when one employs other definitions of an atomic charge.",

To demonstrate the accuracy of FMO2-TDDFT, we computed several low-lying singlet and triplet excited states of solvated phenol and polyalanine using our method and the standard TDDFT for the full system.

The {ETS-NOCV} charge and energy decomposition scheme based on the {Kohn−Sham} approach makes it not only possible to decompose the deformation density, Δρ, into the different components (such as σ, π, δ, etc.) of the chemical bond, but it also provides the corresponding energy contributions to the total bond energy. Thus, the {ETS-NOCV} scheme offers a compact, qualitative, and quantitative picture of the chemical bond formation within one common theoretical framework. Although, the {ETS-NOCV} approach contains a certain arbitrariness in the definition of the molecular subsystems that constitute the whole molecule, it can be widely used for the description of different types of chemical bonds. The applicability of the {ETS-NOCV} scheme is demonstrated for single {(H3X−XH3,} for X = C, Si, Ge, Sn) and multiple {(H2XXH2,} {H3CXXCH3,} for X = C, Ge) covalent bonds between main group elements, for sextuple and quadruple bonds between metal centers {(Cr2,} Mo2, W2, {[Cl4CrCrCl4]4-),} and for double bonds between a metal and a main group element {((CO)5CrXH2,} for X = C, Si, Ge, Sn).
