	abstract = "I use the term “foldamer” to describe any polymer with a strong tendency to adopt a specific compact conformation. Among proteins, the term “compact” is associated with tertiary structure, and there is as yet no synthetic polymer that displays a specific tertiary structure. Protein tertiary structure arises from the assembly of elements of regular secondary structure (helices, sheets, and turns). The first step in foldamer design must therefore be to identify new backbones with well-defined secondary structural preferences. “Well-defined” in this case means that the conformational preference should be displayed in solution by oligomers of modest length, and I will designate as a foldamer any oligomer that meets this criterion. Within the past decade, a handful of research groups have described unnatural oligomers with interesting conformational propensities. The motivations behind such efforts are varied, but these studies suggest a collective, emerging realization that control over oligomer and polymer folding could lead to new types of molecules with useful properties. The purpose of this “manifesto” is to introduce a large audience to the broad research horizons offered by the concept of synthetic foldamers.",

The calculated total energies compare well with those from the conventional ab initio MO method; the errors were within 2 kcalrmol. It indicates that the fragment MO method is sufficiently accurate and useful to study electronic properties of large molecules.",

	abstract = "(Excerpt) The breadth of structure and function displayed by the molecules of biology is remarkable. Considering that there are only three major biopolymer backbones (proteins, ribonucleic acids, and polysaccharides), nature vividly teaches that copolymer sequence is a powerful way to meet diverse chemical challenges. It is logical then to ask are biomacromolecule building blocks are matchless in their suitability for life? Systematic studies on alternative monomers closely related to those found in nature have provided clues about the fitness of R-amino acids, ribofuranosyl (5′f3′) nucleic acids, and phosphodiester linkages. Yet “why nature is such, and not otherwise”1 is a question that continues to be asked. Looking beyond the biopolymers and their related derivatives however, it is possible to imagine that other chain molecules are capable of similar functions. This prediction has only recently begun to be tested, raising questions of great fundamental interest. On a more practical level, the discovery of new functional polymers clearly has widespread potential for both chemistry and biology.",

The procedure is evaluated by computing the relative conformational energies, deltaE(conf), of the alanine tetrapeptide in 10 representative conformations, which were originally derived by Beachy et al. (J Am Chem Soc 1997, 119, 5908) to benchmark molecular mechanics procedures with respect to ab initio computations. In the present study, a particular emphasis is on the separable nature of the components of the energy and the particular impact of the polarization energy component on deltaE(conf). We perform comparisons with respect to single-point HF, DFT, LMP2, and MP2 computations done at the SIBFA-derived energy minima. Such comparisons are made first for the 10 conformers derived from phi/psi torsional angle energy-minimization (the rigid rotor approach), and, in a second step, after allowing additional relaxation of the C-alpha centered valence angles. In both series of energy-minimization, the SIBFA deltaE(conf) compared best with the LMP2 results using the 6-311G** basis set, the rms being 1.3 kcal/mol. In the absence of the polarization component, the rms is 3.5 kcal/mol. In both series of minimizations, the magnitudes of deltaE(conf), computed as differences with respect to the most stable conformer taken as energy zero, decrease along the series: HF > DFT > LMP2 > SIBFA > MP2, indicative of increasing stabilization of the most highly folded conformers.",

We have developed the analytic derivative of the electrostatic interaction between far separated fragments and performed a number of restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) geometry optimizations using FMO and ab initio methods. In particular, the alpha-helix, beta-turn, and extended conformers of a 10-residue polyalanine were studied and the good FMO accuracy was established (the rms deviations for the former two forms were about 0.2 A and for the latter structure about 0.001 A). Met-enkephalin dimer was used as a model for the polypeptide binding and computed at the 3-21G and 6-31G* levels with a similar accuracy achieved; the error in the binding energy predictions (FMO vs ab initio) was 1-3 kcal/mol. Chignolin (PDB: 1uao) and an agonist polypeptide of the erythropoietin receptor protein (emp1) were optimized at the 3-21(+)G level, with the rms deviation from ab initio of about 0.2 A, or 0.5 degrees in terms of bond angles. The effect of solvation on the structure optimization was studied in chignolin and the Trp-cage miniprotein construct (PDB:1l2y), by describing water with TIP3P. The computed structures in gas phase and solution are compared to each other and experiment.",
