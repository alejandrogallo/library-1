The method eliminates lengthy staining and destaining procedures and resolves species of DNA which are less than 7 X 106 daltons. As little as 0.05 pg of DNA can easily be detected by direct examination of the gels in ultraviolet light. Using this technique, we have identified two different restricting activities in extracts of Haemophilus parainfluenzae. The two activities have different chromatographic properties on phosphocellulose and Bio-Gel A-OSm, and they attack SV40 DNA at different sites. One activity (Hpa 11) cleaves SV40 DNA at a single position situated 0.38 fractional genome length from the insertion point of SV40 sequences into the adenovirus SV40 hybrid Ad2++NDl. The other activity (Hpa I) cleaves SV40 DNA at three sites which appear to coincide with 3 of the 11 cleavage points attacked by a restriction system isolated from H. influenzae strain Rd.",

	abstract = "Fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) is a mammalian integral membrane enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis of a number of neuromodulatory fatty acid amides, including the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide and the sleep-inducing lipid oleamide. FAAH belongs to a large class of hydrolytic enzymes termed the “amidase signature family,” whose members are defined by a conserved stretch of approximately 130 amino acids termed the “amidase signature sequence.” Recently, site-directed mutagenesis studies of FAAH have targeted a limited number of conserved residues in the amidase signature sequence of the enzyme, identifying Ser-241 as the catalytic nucleophile and Lys-142 as an acid/base catalyst. The roles of several other conserved residues with potentially important and/or overlapping catalytic functions have not yet been examined. In this study, we have mutated all potentially catalytic residues in FAAH that are conserved among members of the amidase signature family, and have assessed their individual roles in catalysis through chemical labeling and kinetic methods. Several of these residues appear to serve primarily structural roles, as their mutation produced FAAH variants with considerable catalytic activity but reduced expression in prokaryotic and/or eukaryotic systems. In contrast, five mutations, K142A, S217A, S218A, S241A, and R243A, decreased the amidase activity of FAAH greater than 100-fold without detectably impacting the structural integrity of the enzyme. The pH rate profiles, amide/ester selectivities, and fluorophosphonate reactivities of these mutants revealed distinct catalytic roles for each residue. Of particular interest, one mutant, R243A, displayed uncompromised esterase activity but severely reduced amidase activity, indicating that the amidase and esterase efficiencies of FAAH can be functionally uncoupled. Collectively, these studies provide evidence that amidase signature enzymes represent a large class of serine-lysine catalytic dyad hydrolases whose evolutionary distribution rivals that of the catalytic triad superfamily.",

	abstract = "The medicinal properties of marijuana have been recognized for centuries, but clinical and societal acceptance of this drug of abuse as a potential therapeutic agent remains ﬁercely debated. An attractive alternative to marijuana-based therapeutics would be to target the molecular pathways that mediate the effects of this drug. To date, these neural signaling pathways have been shown to comprise a cannabinoid receptor (CB1) that binds the active constituent of marijuana, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and a postulated endogenous CB1 ligand anandamide. Although anandamide binds and activates the CB1 receptor in vitro, this compound induces only weak and transient cannabinoid behavioral effects in vivo, possibly a result of its rapid catabolism. Here we show that mice lacking the enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH / ) are severely impaired in their ability to degrade anandamide and when treated with this compound, exhibit an array of intense CB1-dependent behavioral responses, including hypomotility, analgesia, catalepsy, and hypothermia. FAAH / -mice possess 15-fold augmented endogenous brain levels of anandamide and display reduced pain sensation that is reversed by the CB1 antagonist SR141716A. Collectively, these results indicate that FAAH is a key regulator of anandamide signaling in vivo, setting an endogenous cannabinoid tone that modulates pain perception. FAAH may therefore represent an attractive pharmaceutical target for the treatment of pain and neuropsychiatric disorders.",

The recent determination of the three-dimensional structures of {FAAH} and two distantly related bacterial amidase signature enzymes indicates that these enzymes employ an unusual serine-serine-lysine triad for catalysis {(Ser-241/Ser-217/Lys-142} in {FAAH).} Mutagenesis of each of the triad residues in {FAAH} has been shown to severely reduce amidase activity; however, how these residues contribute, both individually and in cooperation, to catalysis remains unclear. Here, through a combination of site-directed mutagenesis, enzyme kinetics, and chemical labeling experiments, we provide evidence that each {FAAH} triad residue plays a distinct role in catalysis. In particular, the mutation of Lys-142 to alanine indicates that this residue functions as both a base involved in the activation of the Ser-241 nucleophile and an acid that participates in the protonation of the substrate leaving group. This latter property appears to support the unusual ability of {FAAH} to hydrolyze amides and esters at equivalent rates. Interestingly, although structural evidence indicates that the impact of Lys-142 on catalysis probably occurs through the bridging Ser-217, the mutation of this latter residue to alanine impaired catalytic activity but left the amide/ester hydrolysis ratios of {FAAH} intact. Collectively, these findings suggest that {FAAH} possesses a specialized active site structure dedicated to a mechanism for competitive amide and ester hydrolysis where nucleophile attack and leaving group protonation occur in a coordinated manner dependent on Lys-142.",

Significant TS stabilization by approximately -23 kcal/mol [MP2/6-31G(d)] relative to the bound substrate is in agreement with that of previous QM/MM modeling and contrasts with suggestions that catalysis by this enzyme arises purely from conformational selection effects. The most important contributions to DTSS come from the residues, Arg90, Arg7, Glu78, a crystallographic water molecule, Arg116, and Arg63, and are dominated by electrostatic effects. Analysis of the differential electrostatic potential of the TS and substrate allows calculation of the catalytic field, predicting the optimal location of charged groups to achieve maximal DTSS. Comparison with the active site of the enzyme from those of several species shows that the positions of charged active site residues correspond closely to the optimal catalytic field, showing that the enzyme has evolved specifically to stabilize the TS relative to the substrate.",

Based on these results, a series of carbamates was designed that display enhanced potency. One agent was converted into a ‘‘click chemistry’’ probe to comprehensively evaluate the proteome reactivity of FAAH-directed carbamates in vivo. These inhibitors were selective for FAAH in the nervous system, but they reacted with several enzymes in peripheral tissues.

To elucidate the hydrolysis mechanisms and the causes behind this variation of selectivity, mixed quantum and molecular mechanics {(QM/MM)} calculations were carried out to obtain free-energy profiles for alternative mechanisms for the enzymatic hydrolyses. The methodology features free-energy perturbation calculations in Monte Carlo simulations with {PDDG/PM3} as the {QM} method. For wild-type {FAAH,} the results support a mechanism, which features proton transfer from Ser217 to Lys142, simultaneous proton transfer from Ser241 to Ser217, and attack of Ser241 on the substrate's carbonyl carbon to yield a tetrahedral intermediate, which subsequently undergoes elimination with simultaneous protonation of the leaving group by a {Lys142-Ser217} proton shuttle. For the {Lys142Ala} mutant, a striking multistep sequence is proposed with simultaneous proton transfer from Ser241 to Ser217, attack of Ser241 on the carbonyl carbon of the substrate, and elimination of the leaving group and its protonation by Ser217. Support comes from the free-energy results, which well reproduce the observation that the {Lys142Ala} mutation in {FAAH} decreases the rate of hydrolysis for oleamide significantly more than for methyl oleate.",

The alpha-aminoalkylphosphonate diphenyl esters are well known as highly efficient serine protease inhibitors. However, their mode of binding has not been verified experimentally in details. For a group of average and potent phosphonic inhibitors of urokinase, flexible docking calculations were performed to gain an insight into the active site interactions responsible for observed enzyme inhibition. The docking results are consistent with the previously suggested mode of inhibitors binding. Subsequently, rigorous ab initio study of binding energy was carried out, followed by its decomposition according to the variation-perturbation procedure to reveal stabilization energy constituents with clear physical meaning. Availability of the experimental inhibitory activities and comparison with theoretical binding energy allows for the validation of theoretical models of inhibition, as well as estimation of the possible potential for binding affinity prediction. Since the docking results accompanied by molecular mechanics optimization suggested that several crucial active site contacts were too short, the optimal distances corresponding to the minimum ab initio interaction energy were also evaluated.

The knowledge of electrostatic, exchange, delocalization, and correlation components of the transition state and substrates stabilization energy arising from each enzyme active site residue allows to examine the most essential physical effects involved in enzymatic catalysis. Consequently, one can build approximate models of the catalytic activity in a systematic and legitimate manner. Whenever the dominant role of electrostatic interactions is recognized or assumed, the properties of an optimal catalytic environment could be simply generalized and visualized by means of catalytic ﬁelds that, in turn, aids the design of new catalysts. Differential transition state stabilization (DTSS) methodology has been applied herein to the phosphoryl transfer reaction catalyzed by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). The MP2 results correlate well with the available experimental data and theoretical ﬁndings indicating that Lys72, Asp166, and the two magnesium ions contribute -22.7, -13.3, -32.4, and -15.2 kcal/mol to differential transition state stabilization, respectively. Although all interaction energy components except that of electron correlation contribution are meaningful, the ﬁrst-order electrostatic term correlates perfectly with MP2 catalytic activity. Catalytic ﬁeld technique was also employed to visualize crucial electrostatic features of an ideal catalyst and to compare the latter with the environment provided by PKA active site. The map of regional electronic chemical potential was used to analyze the unfavorable catalytic effect of Lys168.

They possess the remarkable capacity to accelerate reactions by many orders of magnitude compared to their uncatalyzed counterparts, making feasible crucial processes that would otherwise not occur on biologically relevant timescales. Thus, there is broad interest in understanding the catalytic power of enzymes on a molecular level. Several proposals have been put forward to try to explain this phenomenon, and one that has rapidly gained momentum in recent years is the idea that enzyme dynamics somehow contributes to catalysis. This review examines the dynamical proposal in a critical way, considering basically all reasonable definitions, including (but not limited to) such proposed effects as ‘‘coupling between conformational and chemical motions,’’ ‘‘landscape searches’’ and ‘‘entropy funnels.’’ It is shown that none of these proposed effects have been experimentally demonstrated to contribute to catalysis, nor are they supported by consistent theoretical studies. On the other hand, it is clarified that careful simulation studies have excluded most (if not all) dynamical proposals. This review places significant emphasis on clarifying the role of logical definitions of different catalytic proposals, and on the need for a clear formulation in terms of the assumed potential surface and reaction coordinate. Finally, it is pointed out that electrostatic preorganization actually accounts for the observed catalytic effects of enzymes, through the corresponding changes in the activation free energies.",

There is evidence that fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) is an enzyme for which reaction proceeds via a high-energy, reactive conformation, distinct from the predominant enzyme-substrate complex (Lodola et al. Biophys. J. 2007, 92, L20-22). Identifying the structural causes of differences in reactivity between conformations in such complex systems is not trivial. Here, we show that multivariate analysis of key structural parameters can identify structural determinants of barrier height by analysis of multiple reaction paths. We apply a well-tested quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) method to the ﬁrst step of the acylation reaction between FAAH and oleamide substrate for 36 different starting structures. Geometrical parameters (consisting of the key bond distances that change during the reaction) were collected and used for principal component analysis (PCA), partial least-squares (PLS) regression analysis, and multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis. PCA indicates that different “families” of enzyme-substrate conformations arise from QM/MM molecular dynamics simulation and that rarely sampled, catalytically signiﬁcant conformational states can be identiﬁed. PLS and MLR analyses allowed the construction of linear regression models, correlating the calculated activation barriers with simple geometrical descriptors. These analyses reveal the presence of two fully independent geometrical effects, explaining 78\% of the variation in the activation barrier, which are directly correlated with transition-state stabilization (playing a major role in catalysis) and substrate binding. These results highlight the power of statistical approaches of this type in identifying crucial structural features that contribute to enzyme reactivity.",
