	abstract = "We studied the interaction of bilayer vesicles and adhesive nanoparticles using a brownian dynamics simulation. The nanoparticles are simple models of proteins aor colloids. The adhering nanoparticle induces the morphological change of the vesicle: budding, formation of two vesicles in which only the outer monolayers are connected, and fission. We also show that the nanoparticle promotes the fusion process: fusion-pore opening from a stalk intermediate, a neck-like structure that only connects outer monolayers of two vesicles. The nanoparticle blends the stalk, and induces the pore opening.",

We optimized the model parameters, which are necessary in evaluating the interactions between the particles and the dnesity fields, so that the coarse-grained model can reproduce the structural properties of the reference particle–particle simulations. The development of these specific coarse-grained models suitable for hybrid particle-field simulations opens the way toward simulations of large-scale systems employing models with chemical specificity, especially for biological systems.",
