	abstract = "Polymers can be theoretically and computationally described by models pertaining to different length scales and corresponding time scales. These models have traditionally been used independently of each other. Recently, considerable progress has been made in systematically linking models of different scales. This Review focuses on the generation of lattice and off-lattice coarse-grained polymer models, whose “monomers” correspond to roughly a chemical repeat unit, from chemically detailed atomistic simulations of the same polymers. Computational methods are described as well as applications to polymers in the melt and in solution. The success of multiscale simulations in solving real-world polymer problems that could not be solved in any other way suggests that they will have an important role to play in the future.",

	Volume = "11",
	Pages = "1869–1892",
	abstract = "In this review, we focus on four current related issues in multiscale modeling of soft and biological matter. First, we discuss how to use structural information from detailed models (or experiments) to construct coarse-grained ones in a hierarchical and systematic way. This is discussed in the context of the so-called Henderson theorem and the inverse Monte Carlo method of Lyubartsev and Laaksonen. In the second part, we take a different look at coarse graining by analyzing conformations of molecules. This is done by the application of self-organizing maps, i.e., a neural network type approach. Such an approach can be used to guide the selection of the relevant degrees of freedom. Then, we discuss technical issues related to the popular dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) method. Importantly, the potentials derived using the inverse Monte Carlo method can be used together with the DPD thermostat. In the final part we focus on solvent-free modeling which offers a different route to coarse graining by integrating out the degrees of freedom associated with solvent.",

	abstract = "We present a formalism for the systematic numerical coarse-graining of ﬁeld-theoretic models of ﬂuids that draws upon techniques from both the Monte Carlo renormalization group and particle-based coarse-graining literature. A force-matching technique initially developed for coarse-graining particle-based interaction potentials is adapted to calculate renormalized ﬁeld-theoretic coupling coefﬁcients in a complex-valued ﬁeld theory, and a related method is introduced for coarse-graining ﬁeld-theoretic operators. The viability of this methodology is demonstrated by coarse-graining a ﬁeld-theoretic model of a Gaussian-core ﬂuid and thereby reducing lattice discretization errors.",

	Title = "{Mutliscale modeling of soft matter: scaling of dynamics}",
	Journal = "Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys.",
	Volume = "13",
	Pages = "10412–10420",
	abstract = "Many physical phenomena and properties of soft matter systems are characterized by an interplay of interactions and processes that span a wide range of length- and time scales. Computer simulation approaches require models, which cover these scales. These are typically multiscale models that combine and link different levels of resolution. In order to reach mesoscopic time- and length scales, necessary to access material properties, coarse-grained models are developed. They are based on microscopic, atomistic descriptions of systems and represent these systems on a coarser, mesoscopic level. While the connection between length scales can be established immediately, the link between the different time scales that takes into account the faster dynamics of the coarser system cannot be obtained directly. In this perspective paper we discuss methods that link the time scales in structure based multiscale models. Concepts which try to rigorously map dynamics of related models are limited to simple model systems, while the challenge in soft matter systems is the multitude of fluctuating energy barriers of comparable height. More pragmatic methods to match time scales are applied successfully to quantitatively understand and predict dynamics of one-component soft matter systems. However, there are still open questions. We point out that the link between the dynamics on different resolution levels can be affected by slight changes of the system, as for different tacticities. Furthermore, in two-component systems the dynamics of the host polymer and of additives are accelerated very differently.",
