	abstract = "A theoretical study is made of the equations of state of argon and nitrogen, at high temperatures and densities. The intermolecular potential used is of the Lennard-Jones form, with an adjustable rigid sphere cutoff. A perturbation theory is developed, by which the thermodynamic properties of one system may be related to those of a slightly different system and to the difference in the intermolecular potentials of the two systems. In this article, the unperturbed system is a rigid sphere fluid, and the Lennard-Jones potential is the perturbation. The results are in fair agreement with experiment, and also lead to an experimental test of the theoretical rigid sphere equation of state.",

	abstract = "The perturbation theory described in a previous article is applied to the calculation of the equation of state at high temperature of a polar gas. The electrostatic dipolar potential is considered to be a perturbation on the nonpolar Lennard-Jones potential. The dipole contribution to the equation of state is expressed in terms of properties of the unperturbed system. These properties are obtained from experimental data on argon and xenon. Numerical tables of the reduced equation of state of the polar gas, over a wide temperature and density range, are presented. The theory is tested on water vapor and on methyl fluoride. Theoretical predictions of the pressure agree with experimental data over a wide density range (up to 0.25 g/cc for water) to within several percent.",

Several applications of this new methodology using the semiempirical PM3 method are presented. These examples demonstrate that the technique can be successfully utilized to determine free energy differences in the gas phase. Finally, extension of the methodology to other quantum mechanical approaches and to condensed phases is discussed.",

	abstract = "Understanding the microscopic structure and macroscopic properties of condensed matter from a molecular perspective is important for both traditional and modern chemical engineering. A cornerstone of such understanding is provided by statistical mechanics, which bridges the gap between molecular events and the structural and physiochemical properties of macro- and mesoscopic systems. With ever-increasing computer power, molecular simulations and ab initio quantum mechanics are promising to provide a nearly exact route to accomplishing the full potential of statistical mechanics. However, in light of their versatility for solving problems involving multiple length and timescales that are yet unreachable by direct simulations, phenomenological and semiempirical methods remain relevant for chemical engineering applications in the foreseeable future. Classical density functional theory offers a compromise: on the one hand, it is able to retain the theoretical rigor of statistical mechanics and, on the other hand, similar to a phenomenological method, it demands only modest computational cost for modeling the properties of uniform and inhomogeneous systems. Recent advances are summarized of classical density functional theory with emphasis on applications to quantitative modeling of the phase and interfacial behavior of condensed ﬂuids and soft materials, including colloids, polymer solutions, nanocomposites, liquid crystals, and biological systems. Attention is also given to some potential applications of density functional theory to material fabrications and biomolecular engineering.",

The methodology takes deep root in quantum mechanics but shares a mathematical similarity with a number of classical approaches in statistical mechanics. This review discusses different strategies commonly used to formulate the free-energy functional of complex ﬂuids for either phenomena-oriented applications or as a generic description of the thermodynamic nonideality owing to various components of intermolecular forces. We emphasize the connections among different schemes of DFT approximations, their underlying assumptions, and inherent limitations. We also address extensions of equilibrium DFT to phenomenological theories for the dynamic properties of complex ﬂuids and for the kinetics of phase transitions. In addition, we highlight the recent literature concerning applications of DFT to diverse static and time-dependent phenomena in complex ﬂuids.",
