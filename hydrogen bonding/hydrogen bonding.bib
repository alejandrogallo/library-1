The induction energy is modelled by means of polarizabilities up to rank 2 at the center of mass. The repulsion energy is described by an anisotropic exponential site-site model. For the dispersion, two models have been used: a one-site anisotropic and a two-site isotropic model, both incorporating damping functions. The geometries, binding energies, and barrier height to tunneling motion are in good agreement with previous calculations. We also compare the classical and quantum corrected second virial coefficient with the limited data available. The potential is extended to larger clusters, the induction energy accounting for many-body contributions to the energy.

The unweighted rms deviation for all 3284 points is 21 cm$^{-1}$. Empirical reﬁnements are applied through mixing and scaling of the ab initio data, guided by the comparison of multidimensional nuclear quantum energy levels with experimental data. The resulting semiempirical pair potentials labeled SC-2.9 and SO-3 contain 67 and 61 freely adjusted parameters and are combined with a four parameter monomer potential of generalized Poschl–Teller type. Various minimum energy paths and cuts are investigated. Major improvements over earlier HF dimer potentials are demonstrated via multidimensional solutions of the nuclear Schrodinger equation. Comparison with other high level ab initio calculations and with various experimental data reveals very good overall consistency. The new potential suggests strong Coriolis coupling in the librational degrees of freedom. Best estimates of stationary points, of the dimer dissociation energy ($D\_e$ 19.1$\pm$0.2 kJ/mol), of the electronic barrier to hydrogen bond exchange 4.2$\pm$0.2 kJ/mol , of the electronic barrier to linearity 3.9$\pm$0.2 kJ/mol , and of the electronic barrier to hydrogen exchange 175$\pm$10 kJ/mol are inferred.

Using a triple-zeta basis set with two sets of polarization functions augmented with higher angular momentum and diffuse functions [TZ2P(f,d)+dif], the fully optimized geometries and harmonic vibrational frequencies of these ten stationary points were determined at the CCSD(T) theoretical level. In agreement with other ab initio investigations, only one of these ten stationary points is a true minimum. Of the other nine structures, three are transition structures, and the remaining are higher order saddle points. These high-level ab initio results indicate that the lowest lying transition state involved in hydrogen interchange is chiral, of C-1 symmetry rather than C-s as suggested by recently developed 6D potential energy surfaces. The one- and n-particle limits of the electronic energies of these ten stationary points were probed by systematic variation of the atomic orbital basis sets and the treatment of electron correlation within the framework of the focal-point analysis of Allen and co-workers. The one-particle limit was approached via extrapolation of electronic energies computed with the augmented correlation consistent basis sets (aug-cc-pVXZ, X=D-6), and, independently, by estimating the basis set incompleteness effect with the explicitly-correlated second-order Møller–Plesset method (MP2-R12). Electron correlation was evaluated at levels as high as the Brueckner coupled cluster method with double excitations and perturbatively treated triple and quadruple excitations [BD(TQ)]. Core correlation and relativistic effects were also assessed. Consideration of the aforementioned electronic effects as well as basis set superposition error leads to an estimate of 21.0 kJ mol(-1) for the electronic dissociation energy of (H2O)(2).

	abstract = "A full-dimensional ab initio potential energy surface (PES) and dipole moment surface (DMS) are reported for the water dimer, (H2O)(2). The CCSD(T)-PES is a very precise fit to 19 805 ab initio energies obtained with the coupled-cluster (CCSD(T)) method, using an aug-cc-pVTZ basis. The standard Counterpoise correction was applied to approximately eliminate basis set superposition errors. The fit is based on an approach that incorporates the permutational symmetry of identical atoms [Huang, X.: Braams, B.; Bowman, J. M. J. Chem. Phys. 2005, 122, 044308]. The DMS is a fit to the dipole moment obtained with Møller–Plesset (MP2) theory, using an aug-cc-pVTZ basis. The PES has an RMS fitting error of 31 cm(-1) for energies below 20 000 cm-1, relative to the global minimum. This surface can describe various internal floppy motions, including various monomer inversions, and isomerization pathways. Ten characteristic stationary points have been located on the surface, four of which are transition structures and the rest are higher order saddle points. Their geometrical and vibrational properties are presented and compared with available previous theoretical work. The CCSD(T)-PES and MP2-DMS dissociate correctly (and symmetrically) to two H2O monomers, with D-e 1665.7 cm(-1) (19.93 kJ/mol). Accurate quantum calculations of the zero-point energy of the dimer (using diffusion Monte Carlo) and the monomers (using, a vibrational configuration interaction approach) are reported, and these together with D-e give a value of D-0 of 1042 cm(-1) (12.44 kJ/mol). A best estimated value is 1130 cm(-1) (13.5 kJ/mol).",

	abstract = "In a previous paper [J. Phys. Chem. A 109 (2005) 5608], we developed a charge density treatment of the electrical interaction between a molecule and point charges, which was applied to the electrical component of the hydrogen-bond interaction in donor-molecule/acceptor-charge model systems. This approach has two important advantages: it is very accurate by avoiding the deﬁciencies of multipole treatments, and it provides a complete electrostatic, polarization, and hyperpolarization description of interaction forces as well as energies. In this paper, we present a more general treatment of the theory and an extended demonstration of the physical accuracy of this approach, and we explore the geometric dependence of the parameters of this treatment (charge density, linearly and non-linearly induced charge density, and their derivatives) for a series of ﬂuoromethane molecules interacting with a two-site FH. We ﬁnd that, for variation in linear separation along the C–H/F–H line, these parameters are very well represented by a arKb dependence, a and b being constants. For a large number of conﬁgurations, the relative rms between the predicted energies and atomic forces and the ab initio calculated values is w3–5\%. This study opens the way to a more complete description of the three-dimensional characterization of these parameters.",

The effective interaction energy of water dimer under room temperature conditions was evaluated from the pressure broadening coefficients for rare gases using Permenter-Seaver's relation. Monte Carlo simulations were performed using ab initio molecular orbital calculations to evaluate the interaction energies for the water dimer at 300 K. In this theoretical calculation, the orientations of the two water molecules were statistically treated.",

VR(r) is most predictive of hydrogen bond acidity for r ) 0.55 Å which is less than half the van der Waals radius of hydrogen. Calculated values of VR(r) and minimized electrostatic potential (Vmin) were used to show how molecular electrostatic potential can be used to provide insight into a number of hydrogen bonding phenomena, including lactam self-association, DNA base pairing, and bioisosterism. The effects of hydrogen bond formation on the strengths of other donors in the interacting molecules were explored and quantiﬁed. Implications of these results for modeling hydrogen bond acidity, derivation of atomic charges, and development of polarizable force ﬁelds were discussed.",
