A concise model interaction potential was constructed on the basis of ab initio potential surface points for the dimer and on comparison with ab initio results for the trimer and tetramer. The model was used to investigate key features of cluster growth, starting with the aggregation energies for clusters with up to 10 molecules. Fully anharmonic zero-point vibrational energies were evaluated for these clusters and were found to be a sizable fraction of the well depth for small clusters. Calculations on larger clusters were used to follow the approach to regular structures in large aggregations, the energetics of cluster growth, and the internal rotation potential for hydrogen molecules embedded in a large cluster. It was found that the essentially free rotation involves concerted reorientation of hydrogen molecules in the first surrounding shell.",

Various adsorption positions are studied for C6H5F. The most favorable configuration places H2 above the aromatic plane with its axis pointing toward the middle of the ring. The electronic (van der Waals) interaction energy for the differently substituted benzenes correlates with the ability of the substituents to enrich the aromatic system electronically. The largest interaction energy (among the singly substituted benzenes) is found for aniline (4.5 kJ mol-1). Enlarging the aromatic system increases the interaction energy; the value for coronene amounts to 5.4 kJ mol-1. Extending the basis set and including terms linear in the interelectronic distances increases the interaction energy by about 1 kJ mol-1 relative to that of the TZVPP basis, whereas the inclusion of higher excitations by coupled-cluster calculations (including all single and double excitations with a perturbative estimate of triples, CCSD(T)) decreases the interaction energy by about the same amount.",

For a given nanotube type, what is the maximal loading (H2 coverage)? 3. What is the diameter range and chirality for which H2 adsorption is most energetically favorable? Our simulation results suggest strong dependence of H2 adsorption energies on the nanotube diameter but less dependence on the chirality. Substantial lattice expansion upon H2 adsorption was found. The average adsorption energy increases with the lowering of nanotube diameter (higher curvature) and decreases with higher H2 loading. The calculated H2 vibrational power spectra and radial distribution functions indicate a strong attractive interaction between H2 and nanotube walls. The calculated diffusion coefficients are much higher than what has been reported for H2 in microporous materials such as zeolites, indicating that diffusivity does not present a problem for hydrogen storage in carbon nanotubes.",

Properties of B+-H2 and the related Li+-H2, Na+-H2, and Al+-H2 complexes are explored through ab initio calculations at the MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ level.
