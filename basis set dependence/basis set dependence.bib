Possible location strategies range from monomer-centered basis sets, through the dimer-centered ones, to sets with functions centered at the intermolecular bond. It is shown that the most effective approach is to use the so-called ”monomer plus” basis sets containing, in addition to monomer-centered functions and bond functions, a small number of functions centered on the interacting partner. Using such basis sets for He-2 and (H2O)(2) the best values to date have been obtained for several interaction energy components. The conclusions from this work are relevant also for supermolecular calculations of interaction energies.",

ANO-type and large uncontracted basis sets were used, spreading over a wide range in size; the biggest set included 1046 functions with angular momentum up to (l=7). Core correlation effects were treated accurately by augmenting the original valence basis with extended sets of core polarization functions. The MP2 dimer interaction energy at the basis set limit was determined to -4.94+/-0.02 kcal/mol, with a contribution due to core correlation of -0.04 kcal/mol. Furthermore, based on some elementary considerations from intermolecular perturbation theory, a simple procedure was devised, which brings the counterpoise corrected interaction energies of moderate basis set calculations closer to the basis set limit. The interaction energies so obtained turned out be surprisingly stable with respect to extensions of the basis set. (C) 1997 American Institute of Physics.",

By using the correlation consistent cc-pVTZ basis-set, it was found that B3LYP and VSXC geometries are in good agreement with experiment. B3LYP/cc-pVTZ geometries were then selected for CCSD(T) single-point energy calculations.

	abstract = "A new two-point scheme is proposed for the extrapolation of electron correlation energies obtained with small basis sets. Using the series of correlation-consistent polarized valence basis sets, cc-pVXZ, the basis set truncation error is expressed as EX X + i − . The angular momentum offset i captures differences in effective rates of convergence previously observed for ﬁrst-row molecules. It is based on simple electron counts and tends to values close to 0 for hydrogen-rich compounds and values closer to 1 for pure ﬁrst-row compounds containing several electronegative atoms. The formula is motivated theoretically by the structure of correlation-consistent basis sets which include basis functions up to angular momentum L = X − 1 for hydrogen and helium and up to L = X for ﬁrst-row atoms. It contains three parameters which are calibrated against a large set of 105 reference molecules H, C, N, O, F for extrapolations of MP2 and CCSD valence-shell correlation energies from double- and triple-zeta DT and triple- and quadruple-zeta TQ basis sets. The new model is shown to be three to ﬁve times more accurate than previous two-point schemes using a single parameter, and TQ extrapolations are found to reproduce a small set of available R12 reference data better than even 56 extrapolations using the conventional asymptotic limit formula EX X−3. Applications to a small selection of boron compounds and to neon show very satisfactory results as well. Limitations of the model are discussed.",

	abstract = "The electron correlation energy of two-electron atoms is known to converge asymptotically as L + 1 −3 to the complete basis set limit, where L is the maximum angular momentum quantum number included in the basis set. Numerical evidence has established a similar asymptotic convergence X−3 with the cardinal number X of correlation-consistent basis sets cc-pVXZ for coupled cluster singles and doubles CCSD and second order perturbation theory MP2 calculations of molecules. The main focus of this article is to probe for deviations from asymptotic convergence behavior for practical values of X by deﬁning a trial function X− that for an effective exponent = eff X , X + 1 , X + N provides the correct energy EX+N, when extrapolating from results for two smaller basis sets, EX and EX+1. This analysis is ﬁrst applied to “model” expansions available from analytical theory, and then to a large body of ﬁnite basis set results X = D , T , Q , 5 , 6 for 105 molecules containing H, C, N, O, and F, complemented by a smaller set of 14 molecules for which accurate complete basis set limits are available from MP2-R12 and CCSD-R12 calculations. eff is generally found to vary monotonically with the target of extrapolation, X + N, making results for large but ﬁnite basis sets a useful addition to the limited number of cases where complete basis set limits are available. Signiﬁcant differences in effective convergence behavior are observed between MP2 and CCSD valence correlation energies, between hydrogen-rich and hydrogen-free molecules, and, for He, between partial-wave expansions and correlation-consistent basis sets. Deviations from asymptotic convergence behavior tend to get smaller as X increases, but not always monotonically, and are still quite noticeable even for X = 5. Finally, correlation contributions to atomization energies rather than total energies exhibit a much larger variation of effective convergence behavior, and extrapolations from small basis sets are found to be particularly erratic for molecules containing several electronegative atoms. Observed effects are discussed in the light of results known from analytical theory. A carefully calibrated protocol for extrapolations to the complete basis set limit is presented, based on a single “optimal” exponent opt X , X + 1 , for the entire set of molecules, and compared to similar approaches reported in the literature.",

	Pages = "2053–2075",
	abstract = "Effectiveness of various extrapolation schemes in predicting complete basis set (CBS) values of interaction energies has been investigated for the helium dimer as a function of interatomic separation R. The investigations were performed separately for the leading dispersion and exchange contributions to the interaction energy and for the interaction energy computed using the coupled cluster method with single and double excitations (CCSD). For all these contributions, practically exact reference values were obtained from Gaussian-type geminal calculations. Sequences of orbital basis sets augmented with diffuse and bond functions or augmented with two sets of diffuse functions have been employed, with the cardinal numbers up to X = 7. The functional form EX = ECBS + A(X − k)−α was applied for the extrapolations, where EX is the contribution to the interaction energy computed with a basis set of cardinal number X. The main conclusion of this work is that CBS extrapolations of an appropriate functional form generally improve the accuracy of the interaction energies at a very small additional computational cost (of the order of 10\%) and should be recommended in calculations of interatomic and intermolecular potentials. The effectiveness of the extrapolations signiﬁcantly depends, however, on the interatomic separation R and on the composition of the basis set. Basis sets with midbond functions, well known to provide at a given size much more accurate nonextrapolated results than bases lacking such functions, have been found to perform best also in extrapolations. The X −1 extrapolations of dispersion energies computed with midbond function turned out to be very efﬁcient (except at large R), reducing the errors by an order of magnitude for small X and a factor of two for large X (where the errors of nonextrapolated results are already very small). If midbond functions are not used, the X −3 formula is most appropriate for the dispersion energies. For the exchange component of the interaction energy, the best results are obtained—in both types of basis sets—with the X −4 extrapolation, which leads (in both cases) to almost an order of magnitude reduction of the error. The X −3 and (X − 1)−3 extrapolations work also well, but give smaller improvements. The correlation component of the CCSD interaction energy extrapolates best with α between 2 and 3 for bases with midbond functions and between 3 and 4 for bases without such functions.",
