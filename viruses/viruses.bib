	abstract = "The bacterium-bacteriophage system offers many advantages for the study of the general principles of the host-virus relationship. The availability of precise quantitative methods for analyzing phage growth makes this system suitable for the study of the nature of the inhibition of virus growth by drugs. A majority of the compounds with suppressive activity on phage multiplication have likewise shown suppressive effects on bacterial multiplication (Delbruick and Luria, 1943; Spizizen, 1943; Bailey, 1943; Jones and Schatz, 1946; Cohen and Anderson, 1946; Cohen and Fowler, 1947). In these cases the inhibition appeared to be indirect through inhibition of the metabolism of the host, and possibly aspecific. Recently a reverse phenomenon has been reported, namely, increased yields of phage occurring at bacteriostatic concentrations of penicillin (Price, 1947). Temperatures above optimum for the growth of the host inhibit phage growth with some degree of specificity (Luria, 1943). What appears to be a specific inhibitory effect of a number of acridines and an antiacridine action of ribose nucleic acid has been reported by Fitzgerald and collaborators (1946). The present paper is concerned with the results of further studies on the action of the acridine compound proflavine and with their interpretation in relation to the problem of phage multiplication.",

	abstract = "(Excerpt) This review is divided into four sections. The ﬁrst and second sections cover methods for viral direct counting, reports of naturally occurring virioplankton abundance in a variety of aquatic environments, and the correlation between changes in virus abundance and changes in other important ecological parameters. The third examines aspects of aquatic bacteriophage biology which have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on host infection in aquatic environments. The ﬁnal section focuses on viral infection and lysis, as both a factor in the mortality of host populations and a mechanism inﬂuencing genetic and clonal diversity of host populations. In general, the discussion is focused on in situ measurement of virioplankton populations. Model phage-host systems are included, as appropriate, for background information.",

Interlocking between coat proteins is found to be a key factor determining the stability of the capsids.",

	Journal = "Comput. Biol. Chem.",
	Volume = "32",
	Number = "3",
	Pages = "198 – 211",
	abstract = "The hemagglutinin (HA) protein of the influenza virus binds to the host cell receptor in the early stage of viral infection. A change in binding specificity from avian alpha 2-3 to human alpha 2-6 receptor is essential for optimal human-to-human transmission and pandemics. Therefore, it is important to reveal the key factors governing the binding affinity of HA-receptor complex at the molecular level for the understanding and prediction of influenza pandemics. In this work, on the basis of ab initio fragment molecular orbital (FMO) method, we have carried out the interaction energy analysis of HA-receptor complexes to quantitatively elucidate the binding specificity of HAs to avian and human receptors. To discuss the binding property of influenza HA comprehensively, a number of HAs from human H1, swine H1, avian H3 and avian H5 viruses were analyzed. We performed detailed investigations about the interaction patterns of complexes of various HAs and receptor analogues, and revealed that intra-molecular interactions between conserved residues in HA play an important role for HA-receptor binding. These results may provide a hint to understand the role of conserved acidic residues at the receptor binding site which are destabilized by the electrostatic repulsion with sialic acid. The calculated binding energies and interaction patterns between receptor and HAs are consistent with the binding specificities of each HA and thus explain the receptor binding mechanism. The calculated results in the present analysis have provided a number of viewpoints regarding the models for the HA-receptor binding specificity associated with mutated residues. Examples include the role of Glu190 and Gln226 for the binding specificity of H5 HA. Since H5 HA has not yet been adapted to human receptor and the mechanism of the specificity change is unknown, this result is helpful for the prediction of the change in receptor specificity associated with forthcoming possible pandemics.",

	abstract = "Atomic force microscopy has recently provided highly precise measurements of mechanical properties of various viruses. However, molecular details underlying viral mechanics remain unresolved. Here we report atomic force microscopy nanoindentation experiments on T=4 hepatitis B virus (HBV) capsids combined with coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, which permit interpretation of experimental results at the molecular level. The force response of the indented capsid recorded in simulations agrees with experimental observations. In both experiment and simulation, irreversible capsid deformation is observed for deep indentations. Simulations show the irreversibility to be due to local bending and shifting of capsid proteins, rather than their global rearrangement. These results emphasize the viability of large capsid deformations without significant changes of the mutual positions of HBV capsid proteins, in contrast to the stiffer capsids of other viruses, which exhibit more extensive contacts between their capsid proteins than seen in the case of HBV.",
