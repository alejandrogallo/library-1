The major strength of electrostatic potential derived charges is that they optimally reproduce the intermolecular interaction properties of molecules with a simple two-body additive potential, provided, of course, that a suitably accurate level of quantum mechanical calculation is used to derive the E S P around the molecule. Previously, the major weaknesses of these charges have been that they were not easily transferable between common functional groups in related molecules, they have often been conformationally dependent, and the large charges that frequently occur can be problematic for simulating intramolecular interactions. Introducing restraints in the form of a penalty function into the fitting process considerably reduces the above problems, with only a minor decrease in the quality of the fit to the quantum mechanical ESP. Several other refinements in addition to the restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) fit yield a general and algorithmic charge fitting procedure for generating atom-centered point charges. This approach can thus be recommended for general use in molecular mechanics, molecular dynamics, and free energy calculations for any organic or bioorganic system.",

A complete, quantitative description of the cation-π interaction would involve a number of intermolecular forces, such as charge-quadrupole, charge-dipole, charge-induced dipole, charge transfer, dispersion forces, and, in some cases, a hydrophobic component. However, we have argued that, to first order, the major aspect of the cation-π interaction is electrostatic in nature, involving the interaction of the cation with the large, permanent quadrupole moment of the aromatic. In the present work we describe an evaluation of the extent to which the electrostatic model can rationalize Variations in cation binding abilities among various aromatic systems.

TAE molecular surface distributions of electrostatic potentials are compared with analytical ab initio and empirical (Gasteiger) partial charge reference models for several conformations of test peptides. Surface electrostatic potential distributions computed using TAE multipole representations were found to converge at the octopole level, with incremental improvement observed when hexadecapoles were included. Molecular electrostatic potential ﬁelds that were produced using the TAE method were observed to be responsive to conformational changes and to compare well with ab initio reference distributions. Generation of TAE atom types and their associated multipoles does not involve ﬁtting to sample electrostatic potential ﬁelds, but rather utilizes integrated AIM atomic electron density distributions within representative chemical environments.

As an alternate to current approaches, we have investigated a charge partitioning scheme that is based on the maximally localized Wannier functions. This has the advantage of partitioning the charge, and placing it around the molecule in a chemically meaningful manner. Moreover, higher order multipoles may all be calculated without any undue numerical difﬁculties.

	abstract = "Accurate and fast evaluation of electrostatic interactions in molecular systems is still one of the most challenging tasks in the rapidly advancing field of macromolecular chemistry, including molecular recognition, protein modeling and drug design. One of the most convenient and accurate approaches is based on a Buckingham-type approximation that uses the multipole moment expansion of molecular/atomic charge distributions. In the mid-1980s it was shown that the pseudoatom model commonly used in experimental X-ray charge density studies can be easily combined with the Buckingham-type approach for calculation of electrostatic interactions, plus atom-atom potentials for evaluation of the total interaction energies in molecular systems. While many such studies have been reported, little attention has been paid to the accuracy of evaluation of the purely electrostatic interactions as errors may be absorbed in the semiempirical atom-atom potentials that have to be used to account for exchange repulsion and dispersion forces. This study is aimed at the evaluation of the accuracy of the calculation of electrostatic interaction energies with the Buckingham approach. To eliminate experimental uncertainties, the atomic moments are based on theoretical single-molecule electron densities calculated at various levels of theory. The electrostatic interaction energies for a total of I I dimers of a-glycine, N-acetylglycine and L-(+)-lactic acid structures calculated according to Buckingham with pseudoatom, stockholder and atoms-in-molecules moments are compared with those evaluated with the Morokuma-Ziegler energy decomposition scheme. For a-glycine a comparison with direct “pixel-by-pixel” integration method, recently developed Gavezzotti, is also made. It is found that the theoretical pseudoatom moments combined with the Buckingham model do predict the correct relative electrostatic interactions energies, although the absolute interaction energies are underestimated in some cases. The good agreement between electrostatic interaction energies computed with Morokuma-Ziegler partitioning, Gavezzotti's method, and the Buckingham approach with atoms-in-molecules moments demonstrates that reliable and accurate evaluation of electrostatic interactions in molecular systems of considerable complexity is now feasible.",

This approach unifies asymptotic approximation to intermolecular forces with symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) treatment. Inexpensive asymptotic formulas are applied to interactions of fragments of monomers which are far apart, whereas fairly expensive SAPT formulas are applied to fragments which are near each other, where overlap effects cannot be neglected. This Letter implements the method for the electrostatic interactions. The electrostatic energies are reproduced to 1\% with about dozen or so atoms in near-range regions.",

	abstract = "We propose here an evaluation of chemically intuitive distributed electrostatic moments using the topological analysis of the electron localization function {(ELF).} As this partition of the total charge density provides an accurate representation of the molecular dipole, the distributed electrostatic moments based on the {ELF} partition {(DEMEP)} allows computing of local moments located at non atomic centers such as lone pairs, sigma bonds and pi systems. As the local dipole contribution can be decomposed in polarization and charge transfer components, our results indicate that local dipolar polarization of the lone pairs and chemical reactivity are closely related whereas the charge transfer contribution is the key factor driving the local bond dipole. Results on relevant molecules show that local dipole contributions can be used to rationalize inductive polarization effects in alcohols derivatives and typical hydrogen bond interactions. Moreover, bond quadrupole polarization moments being related to a pi character enable to discuss bond multiplicities, and to sort families of molecules according to their bond order. That way, the nature of the {C\&bond;O} bond has been revisited for several typical systems by means of the {DEMEP} analysis which appears also helpful to discuss aromaticity. Special attention has been given to the carbon monoxide molecule, to the {CuCO} complex and to a weak intramolecular {N{\textbar}—CO} interaction involved in several biological systems. In this latter case, it is confirmed that the bond formation is mainly linked to the {CO} bond polarization. Transferability tests show that the approach is suitable for the design of advanced force fields. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Comput Chem 2008",

The CO electrostatic potential is expressed as an expansion into atomic multipole moments of increasing order up to octopole which are obtained from a distributed multipole analysis. Three models with increasingly accurate molecular multipoles (accurate quadrupole, octopole, and hexadecapole moments, respectively) are developed and used in molecular dynamics simulations. All models with a ﬂuctuating quadrupole moment correctly describe the location of the B-state whereas the sign of the octopole moment differentiates between the FeáááCO and FeáááOC orientation. For the infrared spectrum of photodissociated CO, considerable differences between the three electrostatic models are found. The most detailed electrostatic model correctly reproduces the splitting, shift, and width of the CO spectrum in the B-state. From an analysis of the trajectories, the spectroscopic B1 and B2 states are assigned to the FeáááCO and FeáááOC substates, respectively.",

The astrophysical interest in this band is related to its characteristic shape, which appears to depend on the surrounding ice structure. Herein, molecular dynamics simulations are carried out to analyze the relationship between the structure of the ice and the infrared (IR) spectrum of embedded CO molecules at different concentrations. Instead of conventional force fields, anharmonic potentials are used for the bonded interactions. The electrostatic interactions are more accurately described by means of fluctuating atomic multipole moments (up to quadrupole). The experimentally observed splitting of the CO absorption band (gas phase: 2143 cmÀ1) into a blue- (2152 cmÀ1) and a red-shifted (2138 cmÀ1) signal is also found in the simulations. Complementary atomistic simulations allow us to relate the spectra with the structural features. The distinction between interstitial and substitutional CO molecules as the origin of this splitting is found to be qualitatively correct. However, at increasing CO concentrations, additional effects—such as mutual interactions between CO molecules—become important, and the simplistic picture needs to be revised.",
