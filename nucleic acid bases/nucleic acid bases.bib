At the HF/6-31G(d,p) geometries, the dipole moments, electronic densities and molecular electrostatic potentials (MEPs) were computed using the HF/6-31G(d,p), MP2(fc)/6-31G(d,p), DlT(B3-LYP)/6-31G(d,p), DlT(B3-LYP)/6-31++G(d,p) methods and DFT with inclusion of Becke nonlocal, gradient-corrected exchange energy terms (DFT(NLE) method) with the numerical DNP basis set. The same properties were also computed using the DFT(B3-LYP)/6-31G(d,p) method for the corresponding optimized geometries of the molecules. The charges that reproduce the MEP maps from the ab initio (HF, MP2) and DFT calculations were fitted and compared. The ground state molecular parameters (rotational constants, dipole moments) of the methylated bases are compared with the molecular parameters calculated at the same level for the nonmethylated DNA bases and with available experimental data. The results show that the DFT calculations reproduce well the MP2 results for the MEPs, the ESP charges and the dipole moments of the DNA bases and their N-methylated derivatives.",

With the Lennard- Jones( LJ) potential internuclear distances of frontier atoms between base- pairs differ only by 0.08 Angstrom compared to supermolecular calculations at B3LYP/ 6- 31G( d, p) level. The discrepancy for angles involved in hydrogen bond contacts amounts to only 3.5degrees. The topological model globally reproduces the correct ranking in intermolecular interaction energy (6.5 +/- 6.5 kJ mol(-1)). Subsequently we compare the interaction energy profiles of the topological model with distributed multipole analysis, Merz-Kollman charges and the natural population analysis at the B3LYP/ 6- 311+ G( 2d, p) level. The convergence of the topological multipole expansion is somewhat more favorable than that based on DMA but the two models have similar basis set dependence.

We first explain advantages and limitations of modem QM calculations of nucleobases and provide a brief history of this still rather new field. Then we provide an overview of key electronic properties of standard and selected modified nucleobases, such as their charge distributions, dipole moments, polarizabilities, proton affinities, tautomeric equilibria, and amino group hybridization. Then we continue with hydrogen bonding of nucleobases, by analyzing energetics of standard basepairs,yI mismatched base pairs, thio-base pairs, and others. After this, the nature of aromatic stacking interactions is explained. Also, nonclassical interactions in nucleic acids such as interstrand bifurcated hydrogen bonds, interstrand close amino group contacts, C-H... O interbase contacts, sugars base stacking, intrinsically nonplanar base pairs, out-of-plane hydrogen bonds, and amino-acceptor interactions are commented on. Finally, we overview recent calculations on interactions between nucleic acid bases and metal cations, These studies deal with effects of cation binding on the strength of base pairs, analysis of specific differences among cations, such as the difference between zinc and magnesium, the influence of metalation on protonation and tautomeric equlibria of bases, and cation-pi,T interactions involving nucleobases. In this review, we do not provide methodological details, as these can be found in our preceding reviews.

The electrostatic and the exchange energies have been found to be the most important components of the overall interaction energy, although the dispersion and the induction energies also play important roles. The exchange energy, while typically not the largest in magnitude at the minima, is the most anisotropic component for rotations of the monomers in the plane of the complex.

Stabilization energies were determined as the sum of the complete basis set (CBS) limit of MP2 stabilization energies and the ∆ECCSD(T) - ∆EMP2 correction term evaluated with the 6-31G*(0.25) basis set. The CBS limit was determined by a two-point extrapolation using the aug-cc-pVXZ basis sets for X ) D and T. While the H-bonding energies are comparable to those of base pairs in a crystal and a vacuum, the stacking energies are considerably smaller in a crystal. Despite this, the stacking is still important and accounts for a significant part of the overall stabilization. It contributes equally to the stability of DNA as does H-bonding for AT-rich DNAs, while in the case of GC-rich DNAs it forms about one-third of the total stabilization. Interstrand stacking reaches surprisingly large values, well comparable to the intrastrand ones, and thus contributes significantly to the overall stabilization. The hairpin structure is characterized by significant stacking, and both guanine‚‚‚cytosine pairs possess stacking energies larger than 11.5 kcal/mol. A high portion of stabilization in the studied hairpin comes from stacking (similar to that found for AT-rich DNAs) despite the fact that it contains two GC Watson-Crick pairs having very large H-bonding stabilization.

Complexes between various small molecules (HF, H2O, and NH3) and four main binding sites in (neutral and (N1) anionic) cytosine are considered. Two complexes (O2(N1) and N3(N4)) involve neighboring cytosine proton acceptor and donor sites, which leads to cooperative interactions and bidendate hydrogen bonds. The third (less stable) complex (N4) involves a single cytosine donor. The final (O2-N3) complex involves two cytosine proton acceptors, which leads to an anticooperative hydrogen bonding pattern for H2O and NH3. On the neutral surface, the anticooperative O2-N3 complex is less stable than those involving bidentate hydrogen bonds, and the H2O complex cannot be characterized when diffuse functions are included in the (6-31G(d,p)) basis set. On the contrary, the anionic O2-N3 structure is the most stable complex, while the HF and H2O N3(N4) complexes cannot be characterized with diffuse functions. B3LYP and MP2 potential energy surface scans are used to consider the relationship between the water N3(N4) and O2-N3 complexes. These calculations reveal that diffuse functions reduce the conversion barrier between the two complexes on both the neutral and anionic surfaces, where the reduction leads to a (O2-N3) energy plateau on the neutral surface and complete (N3(N4)) complex destabilization on the anionic surface. From these complexes, the effects of hydrogen bonds on the (N1) acidity of cytosine are determined, and it is found that the trends in the effects of hydrogen bonds on the (N1) acidity are similar for all pyrimidines.",

The experimentally observed stacking arrangement between consecutive bases in DNA and RNA/DNA double helices is shown to enhance their hydrogen bonding ability as opposed to gas phase optimized complexes. This phenomenon results from more repulsive electrostatic interactions as is demonstrated in a model system of cytosine stacked offset-parallel with substituted benzenes. Therefore, the H-bonding capacity of the N3 and O2 atoms of cytosine increases linearly with the electrostatic repulsion between the stacked rings. The local hardness, a density functional theory-based reactivity descriptor, appears to be a key index associated with the molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) minima around H-bond accepting atoms, and is inversely proportional to the electrostatic interaction between stacked molecules. Finally, the MEP minima on surfaces around the bases in experimental structures of DNA and RNA–DNA double helices show that their hydrogen bonding capacity increases when taking more neighboring (intra-strand) stacking partners into account.",

The {MP2} potential energy surfaces of the stacked dimers are considered as a function of four variables (vertical displacement, angle of rotation, horizontal displacement, and tilt angle) using a variety of basis sets. It is found that the maximum stacking interaction energy decreases with the amino acid according to {TRP} {\textgreater} {TYR} {HIS} {\textgreater} {PHE} for both nucleobases. However, the magnitude of the stacking interaction significantly increases upon alkylation (by 50115\%). Comparison of the stacking energies calculated using our surface scans to those estimated from experimental crystal structures indicates that the stacking interactions within the active site of 3-methyladenine {DNA} glycosylase can account for 6575\% of the maximum possible stacking interaction between the relevant molecules. The decrease in stacking in the crystal structure arises due to significant differences in the relative orientations of the nucleobase and amino acid. Nevertheless, alkylation is found to significantly increase the stacking energy when the crystal structure geometries are considered. Our calculations provide computational support for suggestions that alkylation enhances the stacking interactions within the active site of {DNA} repair enzymes, and they give a measure of the magnitude of this enhancement. Our results suggest that alkylation likely plays a more important role in substrate identification and removal than the nature of the aromatic amino acid that interacts with the substrate via stacking interactions.",

Although the calculations support suggestions from experiments that hypoxanthine preferentially binds with cytosine, the trend in the calculated hydrogen-bond strengths for the remaining natural nucleobases do not show a strong correlation with the experimentally predicted binding preferences. However, our calculations suggest that the stacking interactions of hypoxanthine are similar in magnitude to the hydrogen-bonding interactions at all levels of theory (with the exception of B3LYP, which incorrectly predicts stacked dimers to be unstable). Therefore, stacking interactions should also be considered when analyzing the stability of DNA helices containing hypoxanthine and the use of larger models that account for both hydrogen-bonding and stacking within DNA duplexes will likely result in better agreement with experimental observations.

The potential energy surfaces of dimers were searched as a function of the vertical separation, angle of rotation and horizontal displacement between monomers stacked according to their centers of mass. Our calculations reveal that the stacking interactions of adducts for a given nucleobase are dependent on the methylation site (by up to 20 kJ mol(-1)), where the relative magnitudes of the interactions are determined by the dipole moments of the adducts and the proton affinities of nucleobase methylation sites. Nevertheless, the differences in the (gas-phase) stacking of methylated adducts are small compared with the differences between the stacking of the corresponding natural and methylated nucleobases. Indeed, methylation increases the stacking energy by up to 40 kJ mol(-1) (or 135\%). Although immersing the dimers in different solvents decreases the gas-phase stacking energies with an increase in the polarity of the environment, base methylation still has a significant effect on the nucleobase stacking ability in solvents with large dipole moments, and, perhaps more importantly, environments that mimic enzyme active sites. Our results shed light on the workings of DNA repairs enzymes that selectively remove a wide variety of alkylated nucleobases over the natural bases.",

The energies of dimers with the strongest interactions were further studied at the {CCSD(T)/CBS} level of theory, which suggests that the T-shaped interactions in adenine dimers are very strong (up to −35 {kJ} mol−1). Nucleobase methylation to form a cationic damaged base (3-methyladenine) plays a large role in the relative monomer orientations and magnitude of the interactions, which increase by 17−125\%. Most importantly, this study is the first to compare the stacking and T-shaped interactions between all aromatic amino acids and select (natural and damaged) {DNA} nucleobases where the differences between stacking and T-shaped interactions at the {CCSD(T)/CBS} level are small. Therefore, our results indicate that T-shaped interactions cannot be ignored when studying biological processes, and this manuscript discusses the importance of these interactions in the context of {DNA} repair.",

The intermolecular interaction energies were estimated using the second-order {Møller−Plesset} perturbation theory and coupled clusters approach with single and double excitations, while their components have been determined by means of a hybrid variational−perturbational decomposition scheme. Additionally, the topological analysis of an electron density distribution of the studied complexes has been performed. In the case of all of the studied neutral complexes, the main source of stabilization is the delocalizaction energy associated with the electron density deformation upon the interaction which contributes almost half of the total interaction energy. Furthermore, analysis of the interaction induced difference density maps of complexes containing neutral amino acid side chains reveals that the delocalization component involves the electron density changes localized in the double-hydrogen-bonded ring structures. A relatively good correlation between the sum of densities at hydrogen-bond critical points and the {Hartree−Fock} intermolecular interaction energy components (electrostatic, delocalization, and exchange) has been observed for the two independently considered sets of complexes, containing positively charged and neutral amino acid side chains.",

The results obtained in this work clearly show that stacking and hydrogen bonding are deeply connected.

With all methods, results from full geometry optimizations indicate that stacking interactions increase the N7 and O6 proton affinities by about 5-6 kcal mol(-1), the increase being slightly larger for N7. Consistently with these results, hydrogen bond distances between guanine and one water molecule decrease in the stacked system. Moreover, interaction energy between H2O and (G-Tyr) is found to be 2-3 kcal mol(-1) larger than in G center dot center dot center dot H2O. This strengthening arises from the additional Tyr-H2O stabilizing interactions and from a cooperative interplay between stacking and hydrogen bond forces.",

We characterized the potential energy surface of nucleobase−amino acid dimers using the MP2/6-31G*(0.25) method. The stabilization energies in dimers with the strongest interactions were further examined at the CCSD(T)/CBS level of theory. Results at the highest level of theory possible for these systems indicate that both stacking and T-shaped interactions are very close in magnitude to biologically relevant hydrogen bonds. Additionally, T-shaped interactions are as strong, if not stronger, than the corresponding stacking interactions. Our systematic consideration of the interaction energies in 485 possible combinations of monomers shows that a variety of these contacts are essential when considering the role of aromatic amino acids in the binding of proteins to DNA or RNA. This work also illustrates how our calculated binding strengths can be used by biochemists to estimate the magnitude of these noncovalent interactions in a variety of DNA/RNA−protein active sites.",

All of the calculations were performed using the 6-31G**(0.25,0.15) basis set, whereas the HF, MP2 and the MP3 nonadditivities were, for the sake of comparison, also determined with the much larger aug-cc-pVDZ basis set. The HF and MP2 levels do not provide reliable values for many-body terms, making it necessary to go beyond the MP2 level. The benchmark CCSD(T) three- and four-body nonadditivities are reasonably well reproduced at the MP3 level, and almost quantitative agreement is obtained (fortuitously) either on the L-CCD level or as an average of the MP3 and the CCSD results. Reliable values of many-body terms (especially their higher-order correlation contributions) are obtained already when the rather small 6-31G**(0.25,0.15) basis set is used. The four-body term is much smaller when compared to the three-body terms, but it is deﬁnitely not negligible, e.g. in the case of the GC step it represents about 16\% of all of the three- and four-body terms. While investigating the geometry dependence of many-body terms for the GG step at the MP3/6-31G**(0.25,0.15) level, we found that it is necessary to include at least three-body terms in the determination of optimal geometry parameters.",
