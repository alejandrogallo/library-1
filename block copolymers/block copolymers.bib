In particular, the onset of an ordered mesophase from a homogeneous melt is studied and a criterion of the microphase separatin is found. The only relevant paarameters of hte theory turn out to be the product χN (χ is the Flory parameter characterizing A-B interactions; N is the polymerization index) and f, the fraction of monomers A in a chain. It is shown that under certain critical conditions a specific unstable mode appears in the homogeneous copolymer melt; this announces the microphase separation transition (MST). After the MST a mesophase with the periodicity equal to the wavelength of the unstable mode and with the symmetry of a body-centered-cubic (BCC) lattive should appear. For a large range of compositions a bcc mesophase is expected to be a metastable phase. Only two other ordered phases, a hexagonal mesophase and a lamellar mesophase, may be stable near the MST. The regions of stability are calculated and the phase diagram of the system is provided. First-order transition are predicted between different ordered phases. A new method of measuring the parameter χ, crucial for verification of the theory, is proposed.",

The method entails the repeated calculation of two opposing fields-an external potential field U, conjugate to the density field p, and an energetic interaction field E. The external field is calculated by numerical inversion of the density functionals and the energetic interaction field is calculated directly by integratlon over the density field. When the two fields are balanced U=E, we recover the self-consistent field solutions' when the two fields are off balance, the spatial gradient of E-U is the thermodynami force which drives the collective diffusion. We introduce a simple local coupling approximation for the Onsager kinetic coefficients of short freely jointed chains in weakly ordered systems. Fluctuations are added by incorporation of a random Langevin force in the diffusion equation. Numerical results of decomposition in symmetric and asymmetric diblock copolymer melts indicate that the method is capable of describing extremely slow defect annihilation relaxation modes. We find that in the nonlinear regime, the density patterns evolve to metastable states, in which isolated defects separate relatively well-ordered crystalline microdomains. These final states are typical for many industrial applications of incompletely relaxed copolymer melts.",

Subsequently, the undulations grow into larger spatial structures, eventually leading to a final square-lattice pattern. Second, we calculate the Maxwell stress tensor due to the electric field to predict a finite shear modulus in a lamellar state oriented by the electric field. Third, we examine form birefringence in disordered and ordered phases. In particular, the lamellar and hexagonal phases are shown to become birefringent on spatial scales longer than the spacing of lamellae or cylinders, even if the constituent monomers are optically isotropic. This gives rise to enhancement of depolarized light scattering from lamellar microstructures, which has indeed been observed recently. Most predictions in this paper are applicable to many situations other than those in the electric field.",

However, their orientation can flip to perpendicular when the natural period of the lamellae is incommensurate with the film thickness. Experiments and Monte Carlo simulations have indicated that mixed lamellar phases may also occur, but for symmetric diblocks, we find these phases to be slightly unstable relative to perpendicular lamellae. Nevertheless, just a small asymmetry in the molecule stabilizes a mixed lamellar phase.

We discuss the general theory of time evolution of density variables with general kinetic coefﬁcients developed by Kawasaki and Sekimoto, and especially the limits of the theory that yield the local coupling approximation, the collective Rouse dynamics model, and the reptation dynamics model. We show how a simple approximation to the Rouse dynamics model leads to a feasible numerical model that includes the essential physical features of nonlocal kinetic coupling. This results in a dynamic equation for the external potential instead of the density which allows us to perform calculations of microphase separation in copolymer melts with increased relevance to experimental results. As may be expected from a numerical model that includes nonlocal kinetic coupling, the numerical results show an increased computational efﬁciency, less defects in the ﬁnal morphology, and a faster increase of the order parameter compared to local kinetic coupling.",

The ordering process was explored as a function of time and temperature primarily by transmission electron microscopy (TEM): the microdomain structures formed during the ordering process were observed on specimens frozen at particular times in the ordering process. Complementary small-angle X-ray scattering experiments on the specimens before and after freezing assured that the structures existed before freezing were really conserved in the frozen specimens. The TEM observations showed that the ordered grains of the lamellar microdomain were developed in the matrix of the disordered phase and that the grains grew at the expense of the disordered phase at all the temperatures covered in this study. The coexistence of the ordered and disordered phases suggests that this ordering is a nucleation and growth process. We found that the shape of the lamellar grains developed in the disordered phase were very anisotropic at all stages and temperatures covered in this study: the size along the lamellar normals was much larger than that parallel to the lamellar interfaces. Furthermore in the early stage of the ordering, the lamellae formed in the ordered grains were perforated but they eventually become solid lamellae.",

A spring mimics the stretching behavior of a chain fragment and the spring constant is calculated with the Gaussian chain approximation. Simulations were always started from a homogeneous system. We have mainly investigated the ﬁnal morphology, adopted by the system. First, we have studied the bulk behavior. The diblock copolymer forms a hexagonal packed array of A-rich cylinders, embedded in a B-rich matrix. Film calculations have been done by conﬁning a polymer melt in a slit. Both the slit width and surface-polymer interactions were varied. With the outcomes a phase diagram for conﬁned ﬁlms has been constructed. Various phases are predicted: parallel cylinders (C ), perpendicular cylinders (C ), parallel lamellae (L ), and parallel perforated lamellae (CL ). When the ﬁlm surfaces are preferentially wet by either the A or the B block, parallel oriented microdomains are preferred. A perpendicular cylindrical phase is stable when neither the A nor B block preferentially wets the surfaces. The predicted phase diagram is in accordance with experimental data in the literature and explains the experimentally observed differences between ﬁlms of asymmetric block copolymers with only two parameters: the ﬁlm thickness and the energetic preference of the surface for one of the polymer blocks.

For weakly segregated blocks and below a critical value of the field, Ec, surface interactions stabilize stacking of lamellae in a direction parallel to the surfaces. Above the critical field, a first-order phase transition occurs when lamellae in a direction perpendicular to the confining surfaces (and parallel to the field) become stable. The film morphology is then a superposition of parallel and perpendicular lamellae. In contrast to Helfrich-Hurault instability for smectic liquid crystals, the mode that gets critical first has the natural lamellar periodicity. In addition, undulations of adjacent intermaterial dividing surfaces are out-of-phase with each other. For diblock copolymers in the strong segregation regime, we find two critical fields E1 and E2 > E1. As the field is increased from zero above E1, the region in the middle of the film develops an orientation perpendicular to the walls, while the surface regions still have parallel lamellae. When the field is increased above E2, the perpendicular alignment spans the whole film. In another range of parameters, the transition from parallel to perpendicular orientation is direct.",

In all other cases, lamellae adjacent to the substrate were oriented parallel to the substrate surface, whereas in the center of the sample the lamellae oriented in the direction of the applied field.

The alignment process was followed with the block copolymer films in different initial states. Starting from a poorly ordered state, the cylindrical microdomain orientation was biased by the surface field that initially drove the cylindrical microdomains to be oriented parallel to the film surface. With further annealing, the cylinders were disrupted locally and formed ellipsoid-shaped microdomains that, with time, connected into cylindrical microdomains oriented in the field direction. Starting from an ordered state with cylinders parallel to the surface, the applied electric field enhanced fluctuations at the interfaces of the microdomains. The growth of the fluctuations continued until the cylindrical microdomains broke up into spherical microdomains, similar to that seen in the thermoreversible cylinder-to-sphere orderorder transition. With time, the spherical microdomains deformed into ellipsoidal domains that reconnected into cylindrical microdomains oriented at 45o with respect to the applied field direction. Further annealing aligned the tilted cylinders along the applied field direction. This reorientation process was much slower than from the poorly ordered state. The details of the realignment process are supported by computer simulations based on dynamic self-consistent-field theory.",

	abstract = "Recently, a new spotlight has been focused on block copolymers, thoroughly studied for nearly half a century, because of their potential use in numerous nanotechnologies. This renewed interest is a consequence of the self-assembled microdomains characteristic of these materials. The size, shape, and arrangement of these nanoscopic structures are all tunable through synthetic chemistry of the constituent molecules. Capturing the vast technological potential of block copolymers will, in many cases, require precise control over the orientation and alignment of the microdomains. This review summarizes extant applications and alignment techniques and provides an outlook toward the future. In an effort to provide a practical resource for researchers, the article is structured to identify the reported alignment approaches for a given polymer morphology rather than sorting by alignment technique. Speciﬁc materials have also been deemphasized because the alignment methods, with few exceptions, are general to a speciﬁc morphology or set of morphologies. In addition to a detailed summary of traditional methodologies, some very recent results such as optical alignment of liquid crystalline block copolymers, lithographic chemical patterning, and alignment in pores are highlighted.",

In the presence of an electric field the critical temperature of the order-disorder transition is shifted toward its mean-field value. The collective structure factor in the disordered phase becomes anisotropic in the presence of the electric field. Fluctuational modulations of the order parameter along the field direction are strongest suppressed. The latter is in accordance with the parallel orientation of the lamellae in the ordered state.",

The method combines four distinct components as a single coupled system, including (1) non-equilibrium self-consistent ﬁeld theory describing block copolymer self-assembly, (2) multi-ﬂuid Navier–Stokes type hydrodynamics for tracking material transport, (3) constitutive equations modeling viscoelastic phase separation, and (4) rigid wall ﬁelds which represent moving channel boundaries, machine components, and nano-particulate ﬁllers. We also present an eﬃcient, pseudo-spectral implementation for this set of coupled equations which enables practical application of the model in periodic domains. We validate the model by reproducing well known phenomena including equilibrium diblock meso-phases, analytic Stokes ﬂows, and viscoelastic phase separation of glassy/elastic polymer melts. We also demonstrate the stability and accuracy of the numerical implementation by examining its convergence under grid-size reﬁnement.",

The power law dependence of the rate of reorientation derived from computer simulations based on dynamic density functional theory agrees well with the experimental observations.

Therefore, in the past decades, block copolymers have gained considerable potential for nanotechnological applications, such as in nanostructured networks and membranes, nanoparticle templates and high-density data storage media. However, the characteristic size of the resulting structures is usually determined by molecular parameters of the constituent polymer molecules and cannot easily be adjusted on demand. Here, we show that electric d.c. ﬁelds can be used to tune the characteristic spacing of a block-copolymer nanostructure with high accuracy by as much as 6\% in a fully reversible way on a timescale in the range of several milliseconds. We discuss the inﬂuence of various physical parameters on the tuning process and study the time response of the nanostructure to the applied ﬁeld. A tentative explanation of the observed eﬀect is given on the basis of anisotropic polarizabilities and permanent dipole moments of the monomeric constituents. This electric-ﬁeld-induced effect further enhances the high technological potential of block-copolymer-based soft-lithography applications.",

We introduce a general classiﬁcation scheme and consider the role of kinetics and elongational pressure on stability and formation pathway of both equilibrium and metastable structures in detail. We ﬁnd that helicity and threefold connections mediate structural transitions on a larger scale. Moreover, by matching the remaining parameter in our mesoscopic method, the Flory-Huggins parameter , to the experimental system, we obtain a structure that resembles the experimental toroidal structure in great detail.

It was found that the interfacial energies altered both the critical electric ﬁeld strength and the time scales of kinetics. A very strong preferential interfacial interaction suppressed the electric-ﬁeld-induced S-to-C transition even though such a transition occurred on a neutralized surface where the interfacial interactions were balanced. For a moderate interfacial interaction, the S-to-C transition can be induced by an applied electric ﬁeld, but the time scale of the morphology change is much longer. Furthermore, the formation of ionic complexes in the BCP was found to enhance the electric-ﬁeld-induced S-to-C transition even on a native Si substrate without any surface modiﬁcation, providing a simple route to generate ordered arrays of high-aspect-ratio cylinders oriented normal to a ﬁlm surface.",

We identiﬁed two distinct defect types which govern the orientation mechanism. Ring-like (tori) and open-end defects dominate at the early stage of the orientation process, while mainly classic topological defects (disclinations and dislocations) are involved in long-range ordering at the late stages. Comparison of the time evolution of the defect density with the evolution of the orientational order parameter suggests that tori-defects are essential for the effective reorientation.

The response of the copolymer morphology to DC electric ﬁelds is probed at temperatures where the bulk copolymer adopts either the gyroid or the cylindrical phase. At 150C electric ﬁeld alignment results in vertical arrays of cylinders, lamellae, and perforated lamellae while at 180 C the gyroid phase coexists with a standing perforated lamellar phase. We show that both polymer–substrate interactions and substrate topography are critical factors determining substrate reconstruction of the gyroid phase. Spontaneous cross-ﬁlm percolation of the minority network phase on a given substrate, a prerequisite for electrochemical replication, is dependent on surface topology at the scale of the gyroid unit cell. Importantly, under suitable processing conditions all these complex copolymer morphologies can be electrochemically replicated to produce highly ordered freestanding nanostructured arrays over large areas.",
