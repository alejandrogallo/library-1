The availability of precise quantitative methods for analyzing phage growth makes this system suitable for the study of the nature of the inhibition of virus growth by drugs. A majority of the compounds with suppressive activity on phage multiplication have likewise shown suppressive effects on bacterial multiplication (Delbruick and Luria, 1943; Spizizen, 1943; Bailey, 1943; Jones and Schatz, 1946; Cohen and Anderson, 1946; Cohen and Fowler, 1947). In these cases the inhibition appeared to be indirect through inhibition of the metabolism of the host, and possibly aspecific. Recently a reverse phenomenon has been reported, namely, increased yields of phage occurring at bacteriostatic concentrations of penicillin (Price, 1947). Temperatures above optimum for the growth of the host inhibit phage growth with some degree of specificity (Luria, 1943). What appears to be a specific inhibitory effect of a number of acridines and an antiacridine action of ribose nucleic acid has been reported by Fitzgerald and collaborators (1946). The present paper is concerned with the results of further studies on the action of the acridine compound proflavine and with their interpretation in relation to the problem of phage multiplication.",

	abstract = "1. Osmotic shock disrupts particles of phage T2 into material containing nearly all the phage sulfur in a form precipitable by antiphage serum, and capable of specific adsorption to bacteria. It releases into solution nearly all the phage {DNA} in a form not precipitable by antiserum and not adsorbable to bacteria. The sulfur-containing protein of the phage particle evidently makes up a membrane that protects the phage {DNA} from {DNase,} comprises the sole or principal antigenic material, and is responsible for attachment of the virus to bacteria.2. Adsorption of T2 to heat-killed bacteria, and heating or alternate freezing and thawing of infected cells, sensitize the {DNA} of the adsorbed phage to {DNase.} These treatments have little or no sensitizing effect on unadsorbed phage. Neither heating nor freezing and thawing releases the phage {DNA} from infected cells, although other cell constituents can be extracted by these methods. These facts suggest that the phage {DNA} forms part of an organized intracellular structure throughout the period of phage growth.3. Adsorption of phage T2 to bacterial debris causes part of the phage {DNA} to appear in solution, leaving the phage sulfur attached to the debris. Another part of the phage {DNA,} corresponding roughly to the remaining half of the {DNA} of the inactivated phage, remains attached to the debris but can be separated from it by {DNase.} Phage T4 behaves similarly, although the two phages can be shown to attach to different combining sites. The inactivation of phage by bacterial debris is evidently accompanied by the rupture of the viral membrane.4. Suspensions of infected cells agitated in a Waring blendor release 75 per cent of the phage sulfur and only 15 per cent of the phage phosphorus to the solution as a result of the applied shearing force. The cells remain capable of yielding phage progeny.5. The facts stated show that most of the phage sulfur remains at the cell surface and most of the phage {DNA} enters the cell on infection. Whether sulfur-free material other than {DNA} enters the cell has not been determined. The properties of the sulfur-containing residue identify it as essentially unchanged membranes of the phage particles. All types of evidence show that the passage of phage {DNA} into the cell occurs in non-nutrient medium under conditions in which other known steps in viral growth do not occur.6. The phage progeny yielded by bacteria infected with phage labeled with radioactive sulfur contain less than 1 per cent of the parental radioactivity. The progeny of phage particles labeled with radioactive phosphorus contain 30 per cent or more of the parental phosphorus.7. Phage inactivated by dilute formaldehyde is capable of adsorbing to bacteria, but does not release its {DNA} to the cell. This shows that the interaction between phage and bacterium resulting in release of the phage {DNA} from its protective membrane depends on labile components of the phage particle. By contrast, the components of the bacterium essential to this interaction are remarkably stable. The nature of the interaction is otherwise unknown.8. The sulfur-containing protein of resting phage particles is confined to a protective coat that is responsible for the adsorption to bacteria, and functions as an instrument for the injection of the phage {DNA} into the cell. This protein probably has no function in the growth of intracellular phage. The {DNA} has some function. Further chemical inferences should not be drawn from the experiments presented.",

A subsequent closer investigation of density and water content in relation to the prominent equatorial spacing, and also of equatorial intensities calculated from a projection of the proposed structure, makes it clear that in detail the structure is not consistent with the observed equatorial reflexions.

Characteristic changes, which suggest considerable modification of the usual helical structure of DNA, are found in the X -ray diffraction patterns of fibers of the complex with proflavine. It is inferred that these compounds, which are potent mutagens, are intercalated between adjacent nucleotide-pair layers by extension and unwinding of the deoxyribose-phosphate backbone. The hydrodynamic changes are the consequence of the diminished bending between layers, the lengthening of the molecule, and the diminished length-specific mass. The effects are fully reversible at ordinary temperatures. The proposed structural change is compatible with the normal restrictions on bond lengths, angles, and non-bonded contacts, and maintenance of the hydrogen-bonded base pairs perpendicular to the axis of the molecule. Another singly charged dye, pinacyunol, fails to elicit the effects of intercalation, yielding only lowered viscosity and increased sedimentation coefficient.",

The data indicate that these solutes associate extensively in solution and that the association process does not proceed simply to the dimer stage, but continues to form higher polymers. The results are consistent with a set of association processes which have equal equilibrium constants for all successive steps. Equilibrium constants at 25“ and standard free energies for association of purine, uridine and cytidine were found t o be 2.1, 0.6, 0.9 molal-' and -440,290,80 cal./mole, respectively. The interaction of one base with another base was examined by measuring the increase of solubility of adenine-C14or thymine-CI4 in the presence of varying concentrations of a variety of interactants at 25.5' and 38”. The solubility of adenine or thymine was increased by the addition of soluble purine, nucleosides, pyrimidine or phenol, and was essentially unchanged by the addition of cyclohexanol, adonitol or urea. The total base-CI4 in solution was assumed to be composed of the free base in solution and the water-soluble base-interactant complex. Equilibrium constants for these association processes have been estimated, and they agree semiquantitatively with the results from measurements of 4. The tendency for association and interaction of the free bases and nucleosides in solution can be arranged in the series: purine-purine > purine-pyrimidine > pyrimidine-pyrimidine.

Ethidium binds strongly to both DNA and RNA at sites which appear to be saturated when one drug molecule is bound for every 4 or 5 nucleotides. After the primary sites have been filled, a secondary binding process can occur, leading to the precipitation of a complex containing one drug molecule bound per nucleotide. The strong primary binding to DNA is not influenced by the base-composition or by denaturation ofthe DNA, but is sensitive to changes in the salt concentration, particularly when magnesium ions are present. Addition of magnesium chloride causes a marked reduction in the strength of the interaction without significantly affecting the number of sites available to bind the drug. The process of complex formation is shown to be reversible in solution by demonstrating an exchange reaction between free and bound ethidium. Complexes between ethidium and DNA can be dissociated by using a cation-exchange resin. The binding of ethidium to DNA follows a similar pattern to that found with proflavine, suggesting that the forces involved in the binding of the two drugs may be similar.",

T h e notion of a molecule as a collection of bonded atoms with a definite structure and shape is one which has meaning in real, Euclidean space. I t should therefore be a consequence of a property of the system which is itself manifest in real space. It is shown that a particular topological property of the charge density, p ( r ) , defines the boundaries between pairs of bonded atoms (it defines an atom) and the network of bonds which link them (it defines structure). T h e definition of the boundary is universal and it defines the boundary of the molecule, as well as of the atoms within it (it defines molecular shape). These definitions apply to both stationary and dynamic systems. Thus the notions of the making and breaking of chemical bonds are also precisely defined. T h e boundary defined in the usual formulations of quantum mechanics is the one a t infinity where the boundary condition on the variation of is satisfied. These approaches are necessarily restricted in their applications to a total, isolated system. One may obtain a formulation of quantum mechanics which does define the physical subspaces of a system and yields a prediction and description of their average properties. The boundaries of these subspaces are found to be identical with the physical boundaries defined by the topological properties of p(r). The observational and theoretical basis for these definitions is presented and illustrated for the diborane molecule. This paper serves as an introduction to a theory of bonding and molecular structure which is entirely determined by the observed properties of the charge density.",

This approach finds its natural expression in Rene Thom's general analysis of structural stability as it applies to a system whose behavior is describable in terms of the gradient of some scalar field. Chemical observations are made in real space, and thus chemical behavior is determined by the morphology of a system's charge distribution and its evolution with time. The analysis of the topological properties in $\rho(r)$ via the associated gradient vector field reduced to the identification of the critical points in $\rho(r)$. Two types of critical points assume special roles in the analysis. A (3,-3) critical point, a maximum in the density, is an attractor and is identified with the position of a nucleus in the molecular system under study. The basin of the attractor defines the atom associated with the corresponding nucleus. A (3,-1) critical point defines the interatomic surface separating two neighboring atoms, and the bond path linking their nuclei, the line along which the charge density is maximum with respect to lateral displacements. hence, neighboring atoms are defined to be bonded to one another and the network of bond pahts, for a given nuclear configuration, determines its molecualr graph. Structure is defined as that set of molecular graphs which contain the same number of bond paths, linking the same nuclei. Thus a change in structure necessitates a change in the number and/or arrangement of bond paths. The making and/or breaking of chemical bonds associated with such a change is topologically a discontinuous process, and the associated change in structure is therefore, abrupt: a continuous change in the nuclear coordinates, the parameters which control the behavior of the system, can lead to a discontinuous change in molecules's behavior. A point in control space defining the nuclear configuration for which such discontinuous behavior is observed, is called a catastrphe point. The set of catastrophe points this partitions nuclear configuration space into regions of different structure. The breaking or making of bonds is a catastrophe of the bifurcation type, resulting form the formation of a singularity in $\rho(r)$, whereas the switching of a bond from one nucleus to another is a catastrophe of the conflict type. It is shown that the analytical description of the formation of a three-membered ring structure from all possible neighboring structures is provided by the unfolding of a particular type of catastrophe, the elliptic umbilic.",

The only relevant paarameters of hte theory turn out to be the product χN (χ is the Flory parameter characterizing A-B interactions; N is the polymerization index) and f, the fraction of monomers A in a chain. It is shown that under certain critical conditions a specific unstable mode appears in the homogeneous copolymer melt; this announces the microphase separation transition (MST). After the MST a mesophase with the periodicity equal to the wavelength of the unstable mode and with the symmetry of a body-centered-cubic (BCC) lattive should appear. For a large range of compositions a bcc mesophase is expected to be a metastable phase. Only two other ordered phases, a hexagonal mesophase and a lamellar mesophase, may be stable near the MST. The regions of stability are calculated and the phase diagram of the system is provided. First-order transition are predicted between different ordered phases.

	abstract = "A new theory of inhomogeneous multicomponent systems is developed, starting from the functional integral representation of the partition function. The theory can be used to determine the interfacial properties and microdomain structures of a combination of homopolymers, block copolymers,monomers, and solvents. For the case of no polymers present, our theory reduces to that of Cahn and Hilliard for small molecules. In our approach, the general free energy functional is optimized by the saddle-functionmethod, subject to constraints of no volume change with mixing and constancy of the individual particle numbers, to obtain new equations for the mean fields acting on the polymers. We are thus able to restrict density fluctuations in the system, without introducing an “ad hoc” term involving a vanishing compressibility into the free energy. In addition, by using the gradient expansion for the interaction energy, we demonstrate explicitly the absence of all “kinetic” terms involving the (inverse) degree of polymerization from the mean-field equations, when we choose to introduce the local, homogeneous Flory-Huggins free energy for reference. The mathematical formalism is worked out in detail for the multicomponent homopolymer-solvent system, and it is shown how to extend the theory to include block copolymers. Finally, in order to give a definite example, the variation of the interfacial properties with molecular weight and interaction parameter is worked out numerically for the simplest case of a homopolymer-solventsystem. The numerical method is discussed in detail. Applications to more complicated systems will be given in the future.",

The intercalative binding of this drug to native calf thymus {DNA} has been studied using equilibrium dialysis, spectrophotometry, and competition with ethidium. All three techniques indicate an intrinsic association constant of approximately 1.5 x 10 M at an ionic strength of 0.01. The binding isotherm is adequately described by a neighboring-site exclusion model, and indicates a site size of approximately two base pairs. At elevated ionic strength the association constant is depressed by a factor which corresponds closely to that predicted for a monocationic ligand. Studies with a variety of synthetic polynucleotides indicate that association constants for binding sites of different sequence vary over a 10-fold range. {-AMSA} binds to heat-denatured calf thymus {DNA} or ribosomal {RNA} with association constants, respectively, 5- and 25-fold lower than that for native {DNA.} Comparable measurements have been made with related acridinylaminomethanesulfonanilide {(AMSA)} drugs and simple aminoacridines; they reveal that the presence of an unsubstituted methanesulfonanilide ring does not noticeably interfere with binding to native {DNA.} However, addition of a methoxy substituent at the 3' position of this ring, as in {-AMSA,} may sterically hinder intercalation of the acridine nucleus of the drug. The antitumor activity of the series of ligands studied could not be correlated in any straightforward fashion with nucleic acid binding parameters, although the conspicuous ability of {AMSA} drugs to discriminate sensitively between native {DNA} and {RNA} may result in efficient binding to {DNA} .",

The calculations have been performed in STO-3G, 4-31G, UQ-A, and MODPOT basis sets and compared with some 6-31G* and 6-31G** results. The observed basis set dependence of A\&CF originates mainly from the first-order electrostatic contribution and in particular from the monopole-monopole term in the atomic multipole expansion. The surprisingly good results obtained in the minimal all valence effective core model potential (MODPOT)and uniform quality (UQ-A) basis sets are due to proper monomer charge distribution in these basis sets. In addition a large BSSE has been found for the weakest complexes in 6-31G* and 6-31G** basis sets. STO-3G results, even when corrected for BSSE, seem to be completely unsatisfactory.",

	abstract = "The theory of molecular structure determined by the gradient vector field of the charge density $\rho$ identifies the set of atomic interactions present in a molecule. The interactions so defined are characterized in terms of the properties of the Laplacian of the charge density. A scalar field is oncenctrated in those regions of space where its Laplacian is negative and depleted in those where it is positive. An expression derived from the quantum mechanial stress tensor relates the sign of the laplacian of $\rho$ to the relative magnitude of the local contributions of the potential and kinetic energy densities to their virial theorem averages. By obtaining a map of those regions where the Laplacian is negative, the regions where electronic charge is concentrated, one obtains a map of the regions where the potential energy density makes its dominant contributions to the energy of a system. It is demonstrated that atomic interactions fall into two broad general classes, closed-shell and shared interactions, each characterized by a particular set of mechanical properties. Interactions resulting from the sharing of charge density between atoms, covalent and polar bonds, are caused by a contraction of the charge density towards the line of interaction linking the nuclei. The curvatures of $\rho$ perpendicular to the interaction lines are dominant, electornic charge is concentrated in the internuclear region and the Laplacian is negative. These interaction are characterized by the large negative value of the potential energy in the internuclear region. Interactions between closed-shell atoms as found in noble gas repulsive states, in ionic bonds, in hydrogen bonds, and in van der Waals molecules are governed by the contraction of the charge density towards each of the interacting nuclei. Thus one finds the parallel curvature of $\rho$ to be dominant in these interactions, electronic charge is depleted in the interatomic surface and the Laplacian is negative. The mechanics are characterized by the relatively large value of the kinetic energy, particularly the component parllel to the interaction line. In the closed-shell interactions, the regions of dominenatn potential energy contributions are separately localized within the boundaries of each of the interacting atoms or molecules. In the shared interactions, a region of low potneital energy if contiguous over the basins of both of the interacting atoms. The problem of further classifying a given interaction as belonging to a bound of unbound state of a system is also considered, first from teh electrostatic point of view whereing the regions of charge concentration as determined by the Laplacian of $'rho$ are related to the forces acting on the nuclei. This is followed by and linked to a discussion of the energetics of interactions in terms of the regions of dominant potential and kinetic energy contributions to the virial as again determined by the Laplacian of $'rho$. The properties ofthe Laplacian of the electronic charge thus yield a unified view of atomic interactions, one which incorporates the understandings afforded by the Hellmann-Feynman and virial theorems.",

We illustrate our method of calculation by using the nearest-neighbor data to predict transition enthalpies and free energies for a series of {DNA} oligomers. These predicted values are in excellent agreement with the corresponding values determined experimentally. This agreement demonstrates that a {DNA} duplex structure thermodynamically can be considered to be the sum of its nearest-neighbor interactions. Armed with this knowledge and the nearest-neighbor thermodynamic data reported here, scientists now will be able to predict the stability (delta G degree) and the melting behavior (delta H degree) of any {DNA} duplex structure from inspection of its primary sequence. This capability should prove valuable in numerous applications, such as predicting the stability of a probe-gene complex; selecting optimal conditions for a hybridization experiment; deciding on the minimum length of a probe; predicting the influence of a specific transversion or transition on the stability of an affected {DNA} region; and predicting the relative stabilities of local domains within a {DNA} duplex.",

	abstract = "The theory of atoms in molecules defines an atom and the average values of its properties. The intersection of an atomic surface, as defined by a property of the charge density, with a particular envelope of the charge density defines the volume of an atom in a molecule. The value of the density envelope used to bound the “open” portion of an atomic region can be chosen on the basis of comparison with measured properties. The nature of the results are, in any event, independent of the choice for envelopes which contain over 96\% of the total electronic charge and lie within the usual range of van der Waals contact distances. It is shown that the volumes of methyl and methylene groups in normal hydrocarbons are transferable properties, as are their charge distributions, populations, and energies. The volume of a carbon atom subject to steric crowding is found to decrease as its stability and electron population increase. This behavior is opposite to that found for a carbon atom in a system with geometric strain as found in cyclic and bicyclic molecules. The stability, population, and volume of a carbon atom all undergo parallel increases as the atom is subjected to an increasing degree of geometric strain. The volumes of the bridgehead carbon atoms in bicyclo[ l.l.O]butane and [ l.l.l]propellane are 1.2 and 1.5 times, respectively, the volume of a methyl carbon atom. As anticipated on the basis of the orbital model, an increase in geometric strain is correlated with an increase in s character and thus one finds the electron population, stability, and volume of a carbon atom to undergo the same parallel increases in value through the series ethane, ethylene, acetylene. As a first step in the investigation of how atoms fit together, the changes in the atomic volumes accompanying the formation of a hydrogen bond are determined. The changes in volume are correlated with the changes in the atomic populations and energies for the formation of homo and hetero dimers of water and ammonia and their protonated species.",

	abstract = "This paper uses the theory of atoms in molecules to investigate the origin of molecular dipole moments. The dipole moment is given by a sum over the net charge and first moment of every atom in a molecule. The first term leads to a charge transfer cotnribution $\mu\_c$, the second to an atomic polarization contribution $\mu\_a$. It is shown that both terms are, in general, of equal importnace in determining both the static molecular dipole moments and the moment induced by a nuclear dispalcement. Models which imploy only point charges and corresponding bond moments which follow rigidly the nuclear framework, i.e., models which approximate $\mu\_c$ and ignore $\mu\_a$, are shown to lead to results that are incompatible with the cahnges that are found to occur in a molecualr charge dusturbution during a nuclear vibration. The dipole moment is shown to be another group property that is transferable between molecules in the normal hydrocarbons. This property, along with the net charge, the energy, the correlation energy (expressed as a functional fo the charge density), and the atomic volumes are transferable for methyl and methylene groups because of a corresponding transferability of the distribution of charge over the basins of the atoms in these groups up to their surfaces of zero flux in the gradient vector of the charge density. Trnassferability of group properties is not a result of the trnasferability of individual orbitals or geminals, which necessarily have tails lying outside of the group in question. Atoms have not tails and their energy, as is known from experiment, can in certain instances be transferred between systems with changes of less thatn 1 kcal/mol. The properties of atoms in molecules can be determined experimentally and quantum mechanics predicts these properties, just as it predicts the properties of a total system.",

Such fluctuation corrections, which were neglected in the mean field treatment of Leibler, are found to be significant for the molecular weights usually encountered. The analysis is facilitated by reducing the block copolymer Hamiltonian to a form previously studied by Brazovskii. Our principal results are the following: (i) A symmetric diblock copolymer is predicted to undergo a first order phase transition at a larger value ofXN than the second order transition found by Leibler. The Flory interaction parameter is denoted X and N is the number of statistical segments per chain. The location of the transition is predicted to be at (XN)t = 10.495 + 41.022 N -1/3, where the peak in the scattering function attains its maximum value of 0.12328 N 1/3 • (ii) We find windows in composition, with finite width, through which it is possible to pass from the disordered phase to each ofthe ordered microphases (lamellar, hexagonal, and body-centered-cubic) by changing temperature. (iii) All the results of Leibler are recovered in the limit of block copolymers with infinite molecular weight.",

When used in the truncated configuration space of single and double substitutions, the method, termed QCISD, leads to a tractable set of quadratic equations. The relation of this method to coupled-cluster (CCSD) theory is discussed. A simplified method of adding corrections for triple substitutions is outlined, leading to a method termed QCISD(T).

	abstract = "The theory of atoms in molecules is extended to the case where the molecules is in the presence of an electromagnetic field. This theory is based upon a generalization of quantum mechanics to an open system, as obtained through a corresponding extension of Schinger's principle of stationary action. The extension of this principle is possible only if the open system satisfies a particular boundary condition, one which is expressed as a constraint on the variation of the action integral. This is the condition that it be nouded by a surface of zero flux in the gradient vector field of the charge density, the definition of an atom in a molecule. It is shown that this boundary constraint again suffices to define an atom as a quantum subsystem when the molecule is in the presence of an electromagnetic field. The mechanics of an open system and its properties are determined by the fluxes in corresponding vector current densities through its surface. As in the fieldfree case, the obtainment of these currents from the variation of the action integral is a direct result of the variation of the atomic durface and of the imposition of the variational constraint on its boundary. The currents in this case consist o a paramgnetic and a diamagnetic contribution, currents whose presence are a necessary requirement for the description of the properties of a system in the presence of extternal fields. The variational statement of the Heisenberg equation of motion obtained from the principle of stationary action is used to derive the Ehrenfest force and virial theorems for an atom in a molecule in teh presence of external electric and magnetic fields. In this case, the are forces acting on the interior of the atom which arise from the magnetic presures acting on its surface. it is shown that the molecular electric polarizability and magnetic susceptibility, like other properties, are rigurously expressible as a sum of atomic contributions.",

Larger amounts of memory are used to reduce the 0 evaluations in the MP2 step.

The calculations are performed through the use of coupled-perturbed Hartree-Fock theory. An applied field polarized the atomic charge distirbutions and induces a transfer of charge between them. The resulting changes in the dipole moment per unit applied field determine the corresponding contributions to the polarizability. In general, the component of the polarizability along the internuclear axis in a linear molecuels or in the direction of a chain of bonds in a nonlinear polyatomic molecule, exceeds the perpendicular component because of the transfer of electronic charge between the two ends of the molecules, between the methyl groups in ethane, and between the methylene groups in ethene, for example. Atoms shielded from an applied field, carbon in methane for example, polarize in a direction counter to that of the applied field, responding instead to the opposing field created by the transfer of charge between the exterior atoms. The same behavior is found in vibrationally induced polarizations of a molecualr charge distribution. The extent of atomic polarization and of interatomic charge transfer caused by an external field are readily related to known properties of the atomic charge distributions and the corresponding contributions to the polarizability may be understood and predicted. The mean molecular polarizability and its group contributions are found to be lienarly proprtional to the corresponding sum of atomic volumes, making possible the preditction of molecular polarizabilities from tabulated atomic volumes as determined by the theory of atoms in molecules.",

The dominant operational concept of chemistry is that of an atom in a molecule with a determinable and characteristic set of properties. Thus the physics of chemistry is necessarily the physics of an atom in a molecule, that is of an open system, one which is free to exchange charge and momentum with neighboring atoms. To extend the predictions of physics to the domain of chemistry it is therefore, necessary to generalize quantum mechanics to a subsystem of a total system. Such a generalization is indeed possible, but only if the open system satisfies a particular boundary condition. When this condition is met, one obtains a definition of an atom in a molecule and a prediction of its properties. Inseparable from the quantum definition of an atom in a molecule is the definition of the bonds which link the atoms to yield a molecular structure. In essence, the quantum description of an open system recovers the molecular structure hypothesis-that a molecule is a collection of atoms each with a characteristic set of properties, that are linked by a network of bonds. The emergence of this hypothesis from 19th century experimental chemistry is thus seen as having been an inevitable consequence of physics.",

By varying the model parameters, the diversity in the thermodynamic properties of the model is explored using computer-simulation techniques which faithfully take account of the thermal fluctuations. The calculations are performed in both the canonical and the grand canonical ensembles corresponding to the cases where the concentration of foreign molecules in the membrane is either fixed or varies as the external conditions are changed. A classification of the diverse thermal behaviour, specifically with regard to the phase diagram, the specific heat, the density fluctuations, and the partition coefficient, is suggested with a view to rationalizing a large body of experimental measurements of the effects of different foreign molecules on membrane properties. The range of foreign molecules considered includes compounds as diverse as volatile general anaesthetics like halothane, cocaine-derived local anaesthetics like procaine, calcium-channel blocking drugs like verapamil, antidepressants like chlorpromazine, and anti-cancer agents like adriamycin.",

The structurally similar compounds m-AMSA, AMSA (both active as antitumor agents), and o-AMSA (inactive as an antitumor agent) have been widely studied in their abilities to bind D N A in an intercalative manner. Recent studies from this laboratory reveal distinct differences in the thermodynamic binding mechanisms between m-AMSA and o-AMSA (Wadkins \& Graves, 1989), with the m-AMSA-DNA interaction being an enthalpy-driven process while the binding of o-AMSA to D N A is characterized by more positive entropy values. T o further examine the physical chemical properties associated with these compounds and their correlation with antitumor activities, an in-depth investigation into the thermodynamic parameters of these compounds and structurally related anilinoacridine analogues was performed. These studies demonstrate that substituent type and position on the aniline ring of the anilinoacridines greatly influences both the affinities of these drugs in binding to D N A and dictates whether the D N A binding is an enthalpy- or entropy-driven process. The differences in thermodynamic mechanisms of binding between the two isomers along with molecular modeling studies reveal the electronic and/or steric factors resulting from the positioning of the methoxy substituent group on the anilino ring directs the DNA-binding properties through orientation of the methanesulfonamido group a t the 1’ position of the aniline ring. The orientation of this substituent group may result in favorable contacts through hydrogen bonding with neighboring base pairs and ultimately influence the biological effectiveness as an antitumor agent.",

Three cellular proteins of 70, 85, and 110 kDa coimmunoprecipitated with the octamer motif-binding protein Oct-2 because of the presence of contaminating DNA in the cell extracts. In addition, heterodimer formation between Oct-1 (or Oct-2) and Pit-1 during protein-affinity chromatography was stabilized by the contaminating DNA. In both instances, these DNA-dependent protein associations were selectively inhibited by ethidium bromide in the precipitation reaction without any evident effect on DNA-independent protein associations.

The atomic-charge contribution to the higher molecular moments, as well as to the electrostatic potentials, has been examined for {CO} and {HCN} molecules at several different levels of theory. The results clearly show that the electrostatic potential obtained from {CAMM} expansion is convergent up to the R-5 term for all atomic charge models used. This illustrates that higher atomic moments can be used to supplement any atomic charge model to obtain more accurate description of electrostatic properties.",

	abstract = "The molecular magnetic susceptibility tensor x is expressible as a sum of atomic or group contributions. An atomic contribution consists of a basin and a surface component; the former is given by the integral of a magnetization density over the basin of the atom, and the latter, by the integral of the flux in the position weighted current density through the interatomic surfaces that the atom shares with its bonded neighbors. The surface component is obtained as a consequenceof the.atomic hypervirial theorem defining the average of the velocity operator. Magnetic properties are determined by the observableelectron current density, and the atomic behavior of this field has been correlated with corresponding behavior of the electron density. Thus the importance of the magnetization within an atomic basin relative to the flux in current through its interatomic surfaces parallels the extent to which the electron density is localized within the individual atomic basins. For example, 77\% of the pronounced anisotropy in benzene arises from the flux in current through the interatomic surfaces of the ring atoms induced by a field applied perpendicular to the ring surface. The methyl and methylene group contributions to $\bar{\chi}$ are found to be transferable in the homologous seriesof hydrocarbons and to equal Pascal’s group increments within experimental error.",

	abstract = "W e present a new approach to generating electrostatic potential (ESP) derived charges for molecules. The major strength of electrostatic potential derived charges is that they optimally reproduce the intermolecular interaction properties of molecules with a simple two-body additive potential, provided, of course, that a suitably accurate level of quantum mechanical calculation is used to derive the E S P around the molecule. Previously, the major weaknesses of these charges have been that they were not easily transferable between common functional groups in related molecules, they have often been conformationally dependent, and the large charges that frequently occur can be problematic for simulating intramolecular interactions. Introducing restraints in the form of a penalty function into the fitting process considerably reduces the above problems, with only a minor decrease in the quality of the fit to the quantum mechanical ESP. Several other refinements in addition to the restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) fit yield a general and algorithmic charge fitting procedure for generating atom-centered point charges. This approach can thus be recommended for general use in molecular mechanics, molecular dynamics, and free energy calculations for any organic or bioorganic system.",

Hydroxyrubicin is a synthetic anthracycline antibiotic in which the amine moiety has been replaced by a hydroxyl group, whicfi is uncharged but polar at neutral pH. The comparative binding studies we describe offer a unique opportunity to evaluate the electrostatic contributions to the D N A binding free energy of these anthracycline antibiotics and to test specific predictions arising from current polyelectrolyte theory as applied to ligand-DNA interactions. We find that the quantity (6 log K/6 log [M+]) changes from a value of -0.95 for doxorubicin to -0.18 for hydroxyrubicin. The latter value is in excellent agreement with the value of -0.24 predicted by the theory of Friedman and Manning for the interaction of an uncharged intercalating ligand with DNA. The D N A binding free energy decreases from -8.8 kcal mol-' for doxorubicin to -7.2 kcal mol-' for hydroxyrubicin under solution conditions of 200 mM Na+, p H 7.0, 20 OC. The results we obtain allow us to dissect the D N A binding free energy into its electrostatic and nonelectrostatic components. Knowledge of these values helps to clarify the precise role of the amine group in doxorubicin binding to DNA. In addition, comparison of the D N A binding of doxorubicin with the /3 anomer of doxorubicin provides a striking example of stereoselective antibiotic binding to DNA.",

The method entails the repeated calculation of two opposing fields-an external potential field U, conjugate to the density field p, and an energetic interaction field E. The external field is calculated by numerical inversion of the density functionals and the energetic interaction field is calculated directly by integratlon over the density field. When the two fields are balanced U=E, we recover the self-consistent field solutions' when the two fields are off balance, the spatial gradient of E-U is the thermodynami force which drives the collective diffusion. We introduce a simple local coupling approximation for the Onsager kinetic coefficients of short freely jointed chains in weakly ordered systems. Fluctuations are added by incorporation of a random Langevin force in the diffusion equation. Numerical results of decomposition in symmetric and asymmetric diblock copolymer melts indicate that the method is capable of describing extremely slow defect annihilation relaxation modes. We find that in the nonlinear regime, the density patterns evolve to metastable states, in which isolated defects separate relatively well-ordered crystalline microdomains. These final states are typical for many industrial applications of incompletely relaxed copolymer melts.",

To estimate the mechanical properties of these hybrids, tensile, flexural, impact, and heat distortion tests were carried out. NCH was found superior in strength and modulus and comparable in impact strength to nylon 6. The heat distortion temperature (HDT) of NCH (montmorillonite: 4.7 wt. \%) was 152-degrees-C, which was 87-degrees-C higher than that of nylon 6. In NCHP, saponite had a smaller effect on the increase of these mechanical properties. The modulus and HDT of NCH and NCHP increased with an increase in the amount of clay minerals.

Thus, a gauche-gauche conformation about phosphate is favored for the dimethyl phosphate anion, as is also seen experimentally for phospholipids (and nucleotides). Also, the CCOP torsional angle in the methyl propyl phosphate anion tends to be anti-periplanar or trans, as is the case in most of the structures of phospholipids in crystals and in solution.

	abstract = "The mechanism of intercalation into DNA double helices by ethidium has been analyzed by temperature-jump relaxation and stopped-flow measurements using fluorescence detection. Artifacts due to field- or flow-induced alignment have been eliminated by measurements under magic angle conditions; the theoretical basis for suppression of orientation effects resulting from external forces is given for the case of fluorescence measurements. Excluded site effects have been avoided by restriction to low degrees of binding. The temperature-jump relaxation observed for ethidium binding to DNA could be described by single exponentials under most conditions. The reciprocal time constants increased linearly with the DNA concentration, leading to association rate constants of 2.7 X lo6 M-l s-1 a t 12 OC. These rate constants are virtually independent of the DNA chain length for samples with 200,500,4228, and 30 000 base pairs, showing that the rate is controlled by reaction and not by a diffusive process. At high DNA concentrations around 200 pM, an additional relaxation effect with an amplitude opposite to the main one is observed which is probably due to some conformational change of the DNA-ethidium complex. The results obtained by stopped-flow measurements are consistent with those from T-jump measurements, but owing to higher amplitudes and better signal to noise ratios, the stopped-flow data clearly require two exponentials for satisfactory representation. The reciprocal time constants for both processes increase linearly with the DNA concentration. The simplest mechanism consistent with this result involves parallel formation of two different complexes with a direct transfer of ethidium between the binding sites. The experimental data for a synthetic D N A with one type of base pairs, poly[d(A-T)], are very similar to those for natural DNA; thus, the relatively complex reaction mechanism of intercalation is not due to base-pair heterogeneity. Apparently the two complexes are formed by intercalation of ethidium between the base pairs from the directions of the major and the minor grooves of the double helix. Our results demonstrate that the Joule temperature-jump technique does not introduce artifacts due to field-induced processes, when this technique is used with appropriate care.",

Neural network architectures which help to get the output in real time because of their parallel processing ability, have also been used for segmentation and they work fine even when the noise level is very high. The literature on color image segmentation is not that rich as it is for gray tone images. This paper critically reviews and summarizes some of these techniques.

The augmented Lagrange-function operator and the associated action-integral operator are termed proper operators, since only their variation yields equations of motion for the observables of an open system, in agreement with the expressions obtained from the field equations. Modifying the generator in this manner is shown to be equivalent to requiring that the open system be bounded by a surface through which there is a local zero flux in the gradient vector field of the electron density.

Indeed, these technologies have recently allowed great advances in the understanding of the binary interaction, such that many relevant pair potential energy surfaces are now obtainable by inversion of experimental data or by direct a b initio quantum chemical calculation. Paralleling these developments, many workers have attempted to extend this success to the construction of more general many-body potential energy surfaces, which are ultimately necessary to achieve the goal of describing macroscopic properties from a rigorous microscopic viewpoint.",

The function counterpoise method of Boys and Bernardi enters the procedure naturally, providing an estimate of basis set superposition error (BSSE) . We lind that the energy components exhibit little basis set dependence when BSSE is small. Applications are presented for several representative molecular and ion complexes: the weak hydrogen bond of the water dimer, the strong ionic interaction of the alkali metal hydrides, and the moderate donor-acceptor interactions of BH3NH3 and BH,C!O. Electrostatic interaction dominates the long-range region of the potential energy surface and charge transfer is strongly stabilizing for fragments within van der Waals contact. The repulsive interaction in the short range region of the potential arises from deformation as the fragment wave functions distort to avoid significant interpenetration.",

	abstract = "Molecular species containing inositol are among the most ubiquitous naturally occurring compounds. For example they are commonly found in biomembranes as one of the few head groups of phospholipids. To help characterize their structural properties we have studied the conformational preferences of inositol. It has long been held that among the eight possible cis-trans isomers of inositols shown in Figure 1, the all-equatorial (6e) scyllo-inositol is intrinsically the most stable. However we report here ab initio calculations using Hartree-Fock and second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation methods and also calculations based on density-functional methods, all of which show that this long held view on conformational analysis of isolated inositol molecules is questionable. We have found that the naturally much more abundant myo-inositol, with five equatorial and one axial hydroxyl groups (5e/1a), and the nonnaturally occurring neo-inositol with four equatorial and two axial hydroxyls (4e/2a), tend to be slightly lower in energy than scyllo-inositol. In terms of the free energy, contributions from nuclear motions also favor myo-inositol over scyllo-inositol, making the former consistently more stable. Although an axial hydroxyl group introduces strain energy primarily due to 1,4 O-axial...O and O-axial...C repulsions, it can form more favorable intramolecular hydrogen bonds, which appear to be dominant. The O-axial...H-axial...C interaction also favors the axial hydroxyl orientation. On the other hand, when all intramolecular hydrogen bonds in scyllo- and myo-inositols are removed by properly orienting OH groups, as may occur in aqueous solution or crystals, scyllo becomes lower in energy than myo. Calculations were also carried out on phosphoryl inositols, and the results indicate that axial phosphate substitution may be favored as well. These effects were analyzed in terms of the cyclohexane ring structures and compared with experimental results.",

Experimentally, however, an atom in the bulk exhibits the same electron density in both samples and they possess identical sets of intensive properties. Density functional theory does not account for the fundamental observation underlying the theory of atoms in molecules: that what are apparently identical distributions of charge can be observed for an atom or a grouping of atoms in systems with different external potentials and that these atoms contribute essentially identical amounts to the energies and all other properties of the systems in which they occur. It is shown that, unlike the external potential, the kinetic energy density and the potential energy density, defined by the virial of the Ehrenfest force acting on electron density, are short-range functions. As recorded in the first article on atoms in molecules, they exhibit a local dependence on the electron density that causes them to faithfully mimic the transferability of the atomic charge distributions from one system to another. The electron, the kinetic energy, and the virial densities are all determined directly by the one-electron density matrix, a function termed near-sighted by Professor Kohn. It is this near-sighted property of the one-matrix that underlies the working hypothesis of chemistry - that of a functional group exhibiting a characteristic set of properties. The observations obtained from the theory of atoms in molecules and the atomic theorems it determines demonstrate the existence of a local relationship between the electron density and all properties of a system.",

This allows us to describe the unrestricted Møller–Plesset interaction energy as a sum of fundamental contributions: electrostatic, exchange, induction and dispersion. The supermolecular energies derived within unrestricted Møller–Plesset perturbation theory are analyzed in terms of perturbation theory of intermolecular forces. The latter has been generalized to allow for the description of monomer wave functions within the unrestricted Hartree–Fock approach. The method is applied to the potential energy surfaces for the ﬁrst excited triplet states, $^3A'$ and $^3A''$ , of the He+Cl$\_2$(3$\Pi\_u$) complex. The $^3A'$ and $^3A''$ potential energy surfaces have different shapes. The lower one, $^3A'$ , has a single minimum for the T-shaped structure. The higher one, $^3A''$ , has the global minimum for the T-shaped structure and the secondary minimum for a linear orientation. The calculated well depth for the $^3A'$ state is 31.1 cm$^{-1}$ at the 3.75 Å intersystem separation at the UMP2 level with extended basis set involving bond functions. The $^3A''$ well depth is approximately 2.3 cm$^{-1}$ smaller at this level. This order is reversed by higher correlation effects. The angular and radial behaviors of the individual components of the $^3A'$ and $^3A''$ interaction energies are compared to reveal the different nature of interaction energies in both states. A comparison with the ground state reveals that the $A''$ state has a typical van der Waals character similar to that of the ground state. The $A'$ state, on the other hand, differs considerably from the ground state. The $A'$ and $A''$ states differ primarily in different role of the intramonomer correlation effects.",

Since the {pKa} shift is directly related to the total electrostatic binding free energy of the charged and neutral forms of the ligand, the accuracy of the calculations implies that the electrostatic contributions to binding are accurately predicted as well. Based on our results, we have developed a general physical description of the electrostatic contribution to {ligand-DNA} binding in which the electrostatic binding free energy is described as a balance between the coulombic attraction of a ligand to {DNA} and the disruption of solvent upon binding. Long-range coulombic forces associated with highly charged nucleic acids provide a strong driving force for the interaction of cationic ligands with {DNA.} These favorable electrostatic interactions are, however, largely compensated for by unfavorable changes in the solvation of both the ligand and the {DNA} upon binding. The formation of a {ligand-DNA} complex removes both charged and polar groups at the binding interface from pure solvent while it displaces salt from around the nucleic acid. As a result, the total electrostatic binding free energy is quite small. Consequently, nonpolar interactions, such as tight packing and hydrophobic forces, must play a significant role in {ligand-DNA} stability.",

Subsequently, the undulations grow into larger spatial structures, eventually leading to a final square-lattice pattern. Second, we calculate the Maxwell stress tensor due to the electric field to predict a finite shear modulus in a lamellar state oriented by the electric field. Third, we examine form birefringence in disordered and ordered phases. In particular, the lamellar and hexagonal phases are shown to become birefringent on spatial scales longer than the spacing of lamellae or cylinders, even if the constituent monomers are optically isotropic. This gives rise to enhancement of depolarized light scattering from lamellar microstructures, which has indeed been observed recently. Most predictions in this paper are applicable to many situations other than those in the electric field.",

The set of complexes allows us to draw conclusions about the role of the intermolecular charge density in binding. We find that the values of the charge density and its principal axes of curvature at intermolecular critical points in these systems are an order of magnitude less than those found in hydrogen-bonded systems and that the (3,-1) critical points display the hallmarks of closed-shell interactions. The strong correlation between the value of rho at a bond critical point and the binding energy of the complex that has been found previously for hydrogen-bonded systems is harder to expose with the van der Waals molecules presented here. For example, comparison must be restricted to structures in which the same pairs of atoms are interacting. We find that conflict structures may be associated with both equilibrium and transition state conformations but that significant nonrigidity is usually a consequence. We are able to make some predictions concerning the likely occurrence of intermolecular critical points in systems larger than those described here.",

A geminal extension of the counterpoise procedure of Boys and Bernardi has been proposed to correct for the basis set superposition error. Performance of the proposed correction scheme has been analyzed at the second-order level using a sequence of geminal bases varying in the degree of completeness in representing the intra- and intermonomer correlation effects. The nonlinear parameters of these bases were optimized by minimizing the second-order energy of the helium atom and the second-order dispersion energy of the He dimer. The best upper bounds to date have been obtained for both quantities. The numerical results show that the counterpoise procedure should be used at all levels of basis set completeness. By employing the union of the largest of the obtained bases and reoptimizing some of the nonlinear parameters using the complete second-order energy functional for the dimer, the best estimates to date of the second- and third-order supermolecular interaction energies for He2 have been computed. At the minimum interatomic separation these energies are estimated to be accurate to 0.01 K or better. Adding higher-order terms computed using orbital bases, leads to a helium dimer interaction potential with the depth of 11.00 K, somewhat larger than current experimental results.",

Determination of the salt concentration dependence of the binding constant allowed us to dissect the DNA binding free energy of each compound into its component nonelectrostatic and polyelectrolyte contributions. Comparison of the nonelectrostatic free energy contribution allowed us to evaluate the net energetic contribution of specific functional groups to DNA binding. These quantitative data revealed a surprisingly large and favorable energetic contribution (2 kcal mol(-1)) of the groove-binding daunosamine moiety and a substantial energetic penalty for alteration of its stereochemistry, The energetic cost of removal of hydroxyl groups at the C-9 and C-14 positions (which structural studies indicate may participate in hydrogen-bonding interactions with the DNA) was approximately 1 kcal mol(-1). Replacement of the 3'-amino group with a hydroxyl group led to a loss of 0.7 kcal mol(-1) in binding free energy, above and beyond the energetic penalty resulting from the removal of its positive charge from the antibiotic. The results and analysis presented here provide a rigorous and detailed description of structure-DNA affinity relationships among anthracycline antibiotics. The results are of general interest in understanding how total ligand binding free energies are partitioned among substituents and will be useful in the formulation of rules for the rational design of novel DNA binding agents.",

The structure of the latter was compared with structures obtained from x-ray crystallography and nmr spectroscopy, as well as the theoretically derived ldquoalternating {B-DNArdquo} model {[A.} Klug et al. (1979), Journal of Molecular Biology, Vol. 131, p. 669]. The alternation of twist angles observed in experimental structures was reproduced in the simulation. All four independent simulations of the {drug-DNA} intercalation complex converged in placing the pyridine ring of the ellipticine chromophore in the major groove; in one case this involved a 180° rotation of the drug at the intercalation site. At a more detailed level, the drug is seen to be capable of adopting several distinct orientations, each stable over a period of hundreds of picoseconds. Despite the presence of several polar groups in the drug, however, no direct hydrogen bonding to the {DNA} occurs; instead, interactions between the methyl groups of the drug and the thymine bases at the intercalation site appear important in determining the orientational preferences of the drug. Comparison of the intercalation complexes with the free {DNA} sequence shows a degree of unwinding resulting from intercalation, in good agreement with experimental results, but spread over the three central base-pair steps, not confined to the intercalation site itself. Measurements of torsional rigidity indicate only a slight stiffening of the {DNA} restricted to the immediate site of intercalation. The structures obtained from the {MD} simulations were used to calculate theoretical {CD} spectra, with separate simulations giving very different results. This appears to indicate that given an accurate assignment of the main electronic transition dipole moment of the ellipticine chromophore, discrimination of the more realistic binding geometries may be possible. The relative merits of the various drug orientations observed in the simulations are discussed and a perpendicular orientation of the drug at the intercalation site is considered to be the most consistent with experimental data. While the simulations themselves represent a total of over 2 ns, however, the differences apparent between independent runs indicate that longer simulation times will be required before a complete, unequivocal view of {DNA} intercalation is obtained. © 1996 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.",

The materials design and synthesis rely on the ability of layered silicates to intercalate in the galleries between their layers a wide range of monomers and polymers. Special emphasis i placed on a new, versatile and environmentally benign synthesis approach by polymer melt intercalation. I0contrast to in-situ polymerization and solution intercalation, melt intercalation involves mixing the layered silicate with the polymer and heating the mixture above the softening point of the polymer. Compatibility with various polymers is accomplished by derivatizing the silicates with alkyl ammonium cations via an ion exchange reaction. By hetuning the surface characteristics nanodispersion (i.e. intercalation or delamination) can be accomplished. The resulting polymer layered silicate (PLS) nanocomposites exhibit properties dramatically different from their more conventional counterparts. For example, PLS nanocomposites can attain a particular degree of stiffoesr, strength and barrier properties with far less inorganic content than comparable glass- or mineral reinforced polymers and, therefore, they are far lighter i weight. In addition, PLS nanocomposites exhibit significant increase in thermal stability as well as self-extinguishing characteristics. The combination of improved properties, convenient processing and low cost has already led to a few commercial applications with more currently under development.",

A complete, quantitative description of the cation-π interaction would involve a number of intermolecular forces, such as charge-quadrupole, charge-dipole, charge-induced dipole, charge transfer, dispersion forces, and, in some cases, a hydrophobic component. However, we have argued that, to first order, the major aspect of the cation-π interaction is electrostatic in nature, involving the interaction of the cation with the large, permanent quadrupole moment of the aromatic. In the present work we describe an evaluation of the extent to which the electrostatic model can rationalize Variations in cation binding abilities among various aromatic systems.

The quantum pressure is determined by the virial of the force resulting from the electronic momentum ﬂux through the surface of the open system. A scaling procedure is used to demonstrate that the expectation value of the pressure–volume product of a proper open system is proportional to its surface virial. Previous work, in analogy with the classical virial theorem for a contained system, incorrectly relates the pressure to the external forces of constraint acting on a closed system. A neon vise consisting of a chain of three, four or ﬁve hydrogen molecules compressed between two neon atoms is used to introduce the quantum deﬁnition of pressure and study its effect on the mechanical properties of an atom and on the topology of the electron density. Pressures approaching 160 GPa have been calculated for the vise. The topology of the electron density and the homeomorphism it exhibits with the virial ﬁeld are found to be invariant to an increase in pressure, the electron density accumulating to an ever increasing extent between all pairs of nuclei which serve as the sole attractors. The virial of the Ehrenfest force acting on the surface of a compressed molecule provides a measure of the increase in the electronic kinetic energy resulting from the applied pressure. The effects of pressure on the intra- and intermolecular bonding are discussed in terms of pressure-induced changes in the electron density and in the mechanical properties of the atoms.",

By doing so, the optical properties can be utilized in more technologically important forms such as films and fibers. This review covers many areas of optical composite research to date. Composites with second-and third-order nonlinearities and laser amplification properties are discussed with examples from the recent literature. Other composites, including transparent magnets, may be made using similar structures. The principles used to construct these composites may have important technological applications soon and are therefore summarized in this review.",

In addition, the calculations provide insight into the origins of the major trends that are observed in the experimental data. The values of the step parameters roll, tilt and rise, are determined entirely by the van der Waals interactions, and this reflects the strong requirement that the bases remain stacked in close contact. Slide, shift and twist do not affect the vertical separation of the bases and are therefore less tightly constrained. Electrostatic interactions play an important role in determining the values of shift and slide, but the base-stacking interaction energy is essentially independent of the value of twist. Thus the experimental value of twist is most likely fixed by the constraints of the backbone, which are missing in these calculations. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited.",

However, their orientation can flip to perpendicular when the natural period of the lamellae is incommensurate with the film thickness. Experiments and Monte Carlo simulations have indicated that mixed lamellar phases may also occur, but for symmetric diblocks, we find these phases to be slightly unstable relative to perpendicular lamellae. Nevertheless, just a small asymmetry in the molecule stabilizes a mixed lamellar phase. Although our work focuses on confined films, we do discuss the behavior that results when films are unconfined.",

We show how a simple approximation to the Rouse dynamics model leads to a feasible numerical model that includes the essential physical features of nonlocal kinetic coupling. This results in a dynamic equation for the external potential instead of the density which allows us to perform calculations of microphase separation in copolymer melts with increased relevance to experimental results.

Two sets of compounds were chosen to represent the different characteristics of the {SO2} heterocycles studied: simpler five-member heterocycles and {SO2} small derivatives. These molecules were optimized at the {HF/6-31G*} level and their energy evaluated by a punctual calculation {MP2/6-31G*//HF/6-31G*.} The dipole moments for these molecules were obtained by using all the methods previously mentioned and compared with the {SCF,} {MP2,} and experimental dipole moments. The influence on the charges of some atoms by changing the electronegativity of neighboring atoms has also been investigated for these compounds. The results obtained show that the best methods to describe the electronic distribution of the oxathiole studied are Mulliken and {CHELPG} at the {MP2} level of calculation.

These show acceptable agreement if derived from several independent NMR signals. Less reliable information is obtained from selected UV titrations, from DNA melting differences, from calorimetric measurements and from affinity comparison to polyamines, the latter being based on a fluorescence assay with ethidium bromide. In contrast to literature expectations the naphthalene-shaped ligands show similar affinities irrespective of the presence of nitrogen atoms, or even of charges within the aromatic system, Quinolinium and naphthalene derivatives only intercalate if they bear a positively charged side chain, and then with similar binding constants. Comparison of all systems as well as salt effects demonstrate that the binding can be quantified with additive contributions from salt bridges of the ammonium centres in the side chains, and from the stacking effects of the aromatic parts.

The Ehrenfest force F(r) acting on an element of rho(r) and the virial field nu(r) that determine its potential energy are obtained from equations of motion for the electronic momentum and virial operators, respectively. Each is represented by a dressed density, a distribution in real space that results from replacing the property in question for a single electron with a corresponding density that describes its average interaction with all of the remaining particles in the system. All bond paths, lines of maximum density linking neighboring nuclei in a system in stable electrostatic equilibrium, have a common physical origin in terms of F(r) and nu(r), regardless of the nature of the interaction. Each is homeomorphically mirrored by a virial path, a line of maximally negative potential energy density linking the same nuclei. The presence of a bond path and its associated virial path provide a universal indicator of bonding between the atoms so linked. There is no net force acting on an element of rho(r) or on an atom in a molecule in a stationary state, and nu(r) is attractive everywhere. Thus, contrary to what has appeared in the literature, no repulsive forces act on atoms linked by a bond path, nor on their nuclei. All atomic interactions, including those described as nonbonded and responsible for binding in condensed states of matter, result from a local pairing of the densities of opposite spin electrons. This local pairing, which varies throughout space and with the strength of the interaction, should be distinguished from the notion of an electron pair, as embodied in the Lewis model.",

	abstract = "Understanding the thermodynamics of drug binding to DNA is of both practical and fundamental interest. The practical interest lies in the contribution that thermodynamics can make to the rational design process for the development of new DNA targeted drugs. Thermodynamics offer key insights into the molecular forces that drive complex formation that cannot be obtained by structural or computational studies alone. The fundamental interest in these interactions lies in what they can reveal about the general problems of parsing and predicting ligand binding free energies. For these problems, drug-DNA interactions offer several distinct advantages, among them being that the structures of many drug-DNA complexes are known at high resolution and that such structures reveal that in many cases the drug acts as a rigid body, with little conformational change upon binding. Complete thermodynamic profiles (Delta G, Delta H, Delta S, Delta C-p) for numerous drug-DNA interactions have been obtained with the help of high-sensitivity microcalorimetry. The purpose of this article is to offer a perspective on the interpretation of these thermodynamics parameters, and in particular how they might be correlated with known structural features. Obligatory conformational changes in the DNA to accommodate intercalators and the loss of translational and rotational freedom upon complex formation both present unfavorable free energy barriers for binding. Such barriers must be overcome by favorable free energy contributions from the hydrophobic transfer of ligand from solution into the binding site, polyelectrolyte contributions from coupled ion release, and molecular interactions (hydrogen and ionic bonds, van dei Waals interactions) that form within the binding site. Theoretical and semiempirical tools that allow estimates of these contributions to be made will be discussed, and their use in dissecting experimental data illustrated This process, even at the current level of approximation, can shed considerable light on the drug-DNA binding process.

A new bisintercalating anthracycline antibiotic binds with high affinity to DNA, and appears to overcome a specific form of multidrug resistance. Progress in fundamental studies of drug binding to DNA continues, with detailed thermodynamic studies providing new insights into the forces that drive complex formation. New tools have been developed in order to characterize both the binding mode and the sequence specificity of drug binding to DNA, tools that will enable the fundamental aspects of these biologically important reactions to be understood in more detail.",

Among proteins, the term “compact” is associated with tertiary structure, and there is as yet no synthetic polymer that displays a specific tertiary structure. Protein tertiary structure arises from the assembly of elements of regular secondary structure (helices, sheets, and turns). The first step in foldamer design must therefore be to identify new backbones with well-defined secondary structural preferences. “Well-defined” in this case means that the conformational preference should be displayed in solution by oligomers of modest length, and I will designate as a foldamer any oligomer that meets this criterion. Within the past decade, a handful of research groups have described unnatural oligomers with interesting conformational propensities. The motivations behind such efforts are varied, but these studies suggest a collective, emerging realization that control over oligomer and polymer folding could lead to new types of molecules with useful properties. The purpose of this “manifesto” is to introduce a large audience to the broad research horizons offered by the concept of synthetic foldamers.",

The induction energy is modelled by means of polarizabilities up to rank 2 at the center of mass. The repulsion energy is described by an anisotropic exponential site-site model. For the dispersion, two models have been used: a one-site anisotropic and a two-site isotropic model, both incorporating damping functions. The geometries, binding energies, and barrier height to tunneling motion are in good agreement with previous calculations. We also compare the classical and quantum corrected second virial coefficient with the limited data available. The potential is extended to larger clusters, the induction energy accounting for many-body contributions to the energy.

The transition moment polarizations of 9-hydroxyelliptiycine were determined in polyvinyl alcohol stretched film. Spectroscopic solution studies of the {DNA/drug} complex are combined with theoretical {CD} calculations using the final 50 ps of a series of molecular dynamics simulations as input. The spectroscopic data shows 9-hydroxyellipticine to adopt two main binding modes, one intercalative and the other a stacked binding mode involving the formation of drug oligomers in the {DNA} major groove. Analysis of the intercalated binding mode in {poly[d(A-T)]2} suggests the 9-hydroxyellipticine hydroxyl group lies in the minor groove and hydrogen bonds to water with the pyridine ring protruding into the major groove. The stacked binding mode was examined using resonance light scattering and it was concluded that the drug was forming small oligomer stacks rather than extended aggregates. Reduced linear dichroism measurements suggested a binding geometry that precluded a minor groove binding mode where the plane of the drug makes a 45° angle with the plane of the bases. Thus it was concluded that the drug stacks in the major groove. No obvious differences in the mode of binding of 9-hydroxyellipticine were observed between different {DNA} sequences; however, the stacked binding mode appeared to be more favorable for calf thymus {DNA} and {poly[d(G-C)]2} than for {poly[d(A-T)]2,} an observation that could be explained by the slightly greater steric hindrance of the {poly[d(A-T)]2} major groove. A strong concentration dependence was observed for the two binding modes where intercalation is favored at very low drug load, with stacking interactions becoming more prominent as the drug concentration is increased. Even at {DNA} : drug mixing ratios of 70:1 the stacked binding mode was still important for {GC-rich} {DNAs.} © 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc. Biopoly 46: 127-143, 1998",

The unweighted rms deviation for all 3284 points is 21 cm$^{-1}$. Empirical reﬁnements are applied through mixing and scaling of the ab initio data, guided by the comparison of multidimensional nuclear quantum energy levels with experimental data. The resulting semiempirical pair potentials labeled SC-2.9 and SO-3 contain 67 and 61 freely adjusted parameters and are combined with a four parameter monomer potential of generalized Poschl–Teller type. Various minimum energy paths and cuts are investigated. Major improvements over earlier HF dimer potentials are demonstrated via multidimensional solutions of the nuclear Schrodinger equation. Comparison with other high level ab initio calculations and with various experimental data reveals very good overall consistency. The new potential suggests strong Coriolis coupling in the librational degrees of freedom. Best estimates of stationary points, of the dimer dissociation energy ($D\_e$ 19.1$\pm$0.2 kJ/mol), of the electronic barrier to hydrogen bond exchange 4.2$\pm$0.2 kJ/mol , of the electronic barrier to linearity 3.9$\pm$0.2 kJ/mol , and of the electronic barrier to hydrogen exchange 175$\pm$10 kJ/mol are inferred.

Alternative interpretations of the BB scheme are compared and some problems and paradoxes are described which can consistently be resolved by introducing a hierarchical scheme of N-body CP corrections. In CHA, one identifies those terms of the Hamiltonian (or Fockian) which cause the BSSE-the same terms cause the energy lowering in the “ghost orbitals” calculations; by omitting these terms from the Hamiltonian (Fockian), one can calculate BSSE-free wave functions, by use of which the BSSE-free values of the energy and of other physical quantities can be obtained in a conventional manner. CHA was successfully applied at the SCF and DET levels of theory, including systems containing three or more interacting subsystems or even infinite periodic chains. The pivot full CI calculations performed for small model systems showed the applicability of the approach for treating electron correlation as well. Mast recently, a CHA version of the MP2 theory and a second-order BSSE-free intermolecular PT have also been tested; they are also applicable for complexes of larger size. It was observed, at any level of theory, that the results given by the a posteriori BB and a priori CHA schemes converge to each other much faster than BSSE disappears from the uncorrected results.

The zeroth order Hamiltonian is built up on the BSSE-free but not orthogonal and not necessarily real canonic CHA–SCF orbitals and their orbital energies. As the exclusion of BSSE makes the problem nonHermitian, biorthogonal perturbation theory is used to obtain the ﬁrst order wave function. The second order energy is, however, calculated by using the conventional Hermitian Hamiltonian, in accord with the ‘‘CHA with conventional energy’’ recipe. For that reason we use a generalized Hylleraas functional introduced recently; this guarantees the second order energy to be real even in the case of complex CHA–SCF orbitals. The matrix elements entering the generalized Hylleraas functional are calculated by transforming all wave functions, creation and annihilation operators to an auxiliary orthonormalized basis. The new CHA-MP2 method has been tested on a number of van der Waals complexes and hydrogen bonded systems, by using a variety of different basis sets. In all cases a remarkable agreement has been found with the results given by the Boys and Bernardi’s counterpoise method CP ; this agreement is especially striking in the case of large and well-balanced basis sets. This indicates that the conceptually different CHA and CP schemes both take into account correctly the major BSSE effects.",

Prion diseases may present as genetic, infectious, or sporadic disorders, all of which involve modification of the prion protein (PrP). Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), scrapie of sheep, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) of humans are among the most notable prion diseases. Prions are transmissible particles that are devoid of nucleic acid and seem to be composed exclusively of a modified protein (PrPSc). The normal, cellular PrP (PrPC) is converted into PrPSc through a posttranslational process during which it acquires a high beta-sheet content. The species of a particular prion is encoded by the sequence of the chromosomal PrP gene of the mammals in which it last replicated, In contrast to pathogens carrying a nucleic acid genome, prions appear to encipher strain-specific properties in the tertiary structure of PrPSc. Transgenetic studies argue that PrPSc acts as a template upon which PrPC is refolded into a nascent PrPSc molecule through a process facilitated by another protein. Miniprions generated in transgenic mice expressing PrP, in which nearly half of the residues were deleted, exhibit unique biological properties and should facilitate structural studies of PrPSc. While knowledge about prions has profound implications for studies of the structural plasticity of proteins, investigations of prion diseases suggest that new strategies for the prevention and treatment of these disorders may also find application in the more common degenerative diseases.",

The ordering process was explored as a function of time and temperature primarily by transmission electron microscopy (TEM): the microdomain structures formed during the ordering process were observed on specimens frozen at particular times in the ordering process. Complementary small-angle X-ray scattering experiments on the specimens before and after freezing assured that the structures existed before freezing were really conserved in the frozen specimens. The TEM observations showed that the ordered grains of the lamellar microdomain were developed in the matrix of the disordered phase and that the grains grew at the expense of the disordered phase at all the temperatures covered in this study. The coexistence of the ordered and disordered phases suggests that this ordering is a nucleation and growth process. We found that the shape of the lamellar grains developed in the disordered phase were very anisotropic at all stages and temperatures covered in this study: the size along the lamellar normals was much larger than that parallel to the lamellar interfaces. Furthermore in the early stage of the ordering, the lamellae formed in the ordered grains were perforated but they eventually become solid lamellae.",

They play a pathogenic role in a variety of clinical manifestations, including skin lesions and neonatal lupus heart block. Autoantibodies to Ro(SS-A) recognize a ribonucleoprotein complex composed of small single-stranded RNAs (hYRNAs) and of one or more peptides. Four molecular forms of this complex have been differentiated based on the nature of the peptide: a lymphocyte and an erythrocyte Ro with a 60 kDa peptide, a lymphocyte Ro with a 52 kDa peptide and an erythrocyte Ro with a 54 kDa peptide. The Ro complex is found in most tissues and cells (erythrocytes, platelets), with differences in structure and quantity across tissues, species and embryonic development stages. Although its function remains unknown, its ability to bind nucleic acids and the fact that it shares homologies with gene regulation proteins suggest that it may participate in RNA transcription processes. A number of environmental factors (exposure to ultraviolet radiation, viral infections) may cause translocation of the Ro complex to nucleocytoplasmic and membrane sites where it is not normally found, thereby leading to the development of autoimmunity. The structure of the Ro(SS-A)-hYRNA complex and the development of autoimmunity are currently the focus of active research efforts that can be expected to improve our understanding of the clinical manifestations directly related to anti-Ro(SS-A) antibodies.",

The molecular dipole moment in the crystal is enhanced relative to that from HF and DFT calculations. Topological properties of the molecular electron density differ from theory for the polar bonds but generally agree well for the C-C bonds in the molecule. A major aim of the study is the evaluation of the electrostatic contribution to the intermolecular interactions from the experimental density. The electrostatic interaction energies between pairs of neighboring molecules, as calculated from the experimental density, compare reasonably well with the total interaction energies from supermolecule calculations. The agreement is somewhat improved by the addition of nonelectrostatic repulsion and dispersive terms, which together contribute much less than the electrostatic energy. The electrostatic interaction energy calculated from the CHARMM point-charge force field is often close to the values derived from the experimental charge density, though exceptions occur. In an alternative approach, the topology of the intermolecular charge density is related to the intermolecular interaction energy. The latter approach makes use of a density functional by Abramov (Acta Crystallogr. 1997, A53, 264-272) and a relation between the potential energy density at the bond critical point and the hydrogen bond dissociation energy (Espinosa, et al.

Thus, it is through the pair density that the Lewis model of electronic structure finds physical expression. The pairing of electrons is a consequence of the Pauli principle whose effect is made manifest through the creation of the Fermi hole. The density describing the spatial distribution of the Fermi hole for an electron of given spin determines how the density of that electron is spread out in space, excluding an equivalent amount of same-spin density. The averaging of the Fermi density over single atoms or pairs of atoms determines the corresponding contributions to the total Fermi correlation. It is these terms that yield the localization and delocalization indices that determine the intra- and interatomic distribution of electron pairs that enables one to compare the pairing predicted by theory with that of a Lewis structure. The agreement is best at the {HartreeFock} level, where the Fermi hole is the sole source of correlation between the electrons. The introduction of the remaining correlation, the Coulomb correlation, disrupts the sharing of electron pairs between the atoms, and its effect is therefore, most pronounced for shared interactions. For example, Coulomb correlation reduces the number of shared pairs in N2 from the {HartreeFock} value of three to just above two. In ionic systems, the electrons are strongly localized within each atomic basin and the effect of Coulomb correlation on the atomic pairing is minimal, approaching zero over each of the atomic basins, as it does for the total molecule.",

There will be a significant electrostatic contribution to the binding energy for chromophores with a predominantly positive electrostatic potential, but this varies significantly with sequence, and somewhat with twist angle. The usefulness of these potential maps for understanding the binding of intercalators is explored by calculating the electrostatic Binding energy for 9-aminoacridine, ethidium, and daunomycin in a variety of model binding sites. The electrostatic forces play a major role in the positioning of an intercalating 9-aminoacridine and a significant stabilizing rob in the binding of ethidium in its sterically constrained position, but the intercalation of daunomycin is determined by the side-chain binding. Sequence preferences are likely to be determined by a complex and subtle mixture of effects, with electrostatics being just one component. The electrostatic binding energy is also unlikely to be a major determinant of the twist angle, as its variation with angle is modest for most intercalation sires. Overall the electrostatic potential maps give guidance on how positively charged chromophores can be chemically adapted by heteroatomic substitution to optimise their binding.

DNA structural forms included in the assay ranged from single-stranded forms, through a variety of duplex forms, to multistranded tripler and tetraplex forms.

Standard intercalators (ethidium, daunorubicin, and actinomycin D) served as control compounds and were found to show structural binding preferences fully consistent with their previously published behavior. Standard groove binding agents (DAPI,dystamycin, and netropsin) showed a strong preference for AT-rich duplex DNA forms, along with apparently strong binding to the poly(da)-[poly(dT)](2) tripler. Thermal denaturation studies revealed the apparent tripler binding to be complex, and perhaps to result from displacement of the third strand. Putative tripler (BePI, coralyne, and berberine) and tetraplex [H2TmPyP, 5,10,15,20-tetrakis [4-(trimethylammonio)phenyl] -21H,23H-porphine, and N-methyl mesoporphyrin IX] selective agents showed in many cases less dramatic binding selectivity than anticipated from published reports that compared their binding to only a few structural forms. Coralyne was found to bind strongly to single-stranded poly(dA), a novel and previously unreported interaction.

Concentrated solution (60\%) of (propylene oxide)19(ethylene oxide)33(propylene oxide)19 shows the onset of macrophase separation, with small water droplets dispersed throughout the system.

For the movable-H groups, each connected, closed set of local H-bonds was optimized for both H-bonds and van der Waals overlaps. In addition to the Asn/Gln “flips”, this process included rotation of OH, SH, NH3+ and methionine methyl II atoms, flip and protonation state of histidine rings, interaction with bound ligands, and a simple model of water interactions. However, except for switching N and O identity for amide flips (or N and C identity for His flips), no non-H atoms were shifted. Even in these very high-quality structures, about 20\% of the Asn/Gln side-chains required a 180 degrees flip to optimize H-bonding and/or to avoid NH2 clashes with neighboring atoms (incorporating a conservative score penalty which, for marginal cases, favors the assignment in the original coordinate file). The programs Reduce, Probe, and Mage provide not only a suggested amide orientation, but also a numerical score comparison, a categorization of the marginal cases, and a direct visualization of all relevant interactions in both orientations. Visual examination allowed confirmation of the raw score assignment for about 40\% of those Asn/Gln flips placed within the “marginal” penalty range by the automated algorithm, while uncovering only a small number of cases whose automated assignment was incorrect because of special circumstances not yet handled by the algorithm. It seems that the H-bond and the atomic-clash criteria independently look at the same structural realities: when both criteria gave a clear answer they agreed every time. But consideration of van der Waals clashes settled many additional cases for which H-bonding was either absent or approximately equivalent for the two main alternatives. With this extra information, 86\% of all side-chain amide groups could be oriented quite unambiguously. In the absence of further experimental data, it would probably be inappropriate to assign many more than this. Some of the remaining 14\% are ambiguous because of coordinate error or inadequacy of the theoretical model, but the great majority of ambiguous cases probably occur as a dynamic mix of both flip states in the actual protein molecule. The software and the 100 coordinate files with all H atoms added and optimized and with amide flips corrected are publicly available.",

In a quantum system, the force exerted on the tip is the Ehrenfest force, a force that is balanced by the pressure exerted on every element of its surface, as determined by the quantum stress tensor. The surface separating the tip from the sample is one of local zero flux in the gradient vector field of the electron density, the surface that separates two neighboring atoms. A zero-flux surface also defines a proper open system, one whose observables are governed by the equations of motion, the equation for the electronic momentum yielding the Ehrenfest force theorem. Thus the force measured in the {AFM} is exerted on a surface determined by the boundaries separating the atoms in the tip from those in the sample, and its response is a consequence of the atomic form of matter. This approach to the determination of the force measured in the {AFM} is contrasted with results reported in the literature that equate it to the {Hellmann-Feyman} forces exerted on the nuclei of the atoms in the tip.",

The derivation of the dressed property density, whose averaging over an atomic basin yields the atomic contribution to a given oscillator strength, is achieved through the development of perturbation theory for an open system. A dressed density describes the local contribution resulting from the interaction of a single electron at some position r, as determined by the relevant observable, averaged over the motions of all of the remaining particles in the system. In the present work, the transition probability density expressed in terms of the relevant transition density, yields a local measure of the associated oscillator strength resulting from the interaction of the entire molecule with a radiation ﬁeld. The deﬁnition of the atomic contributions to the oscillator strength enables one to determine the extent to which a given electronic or vibrational transition is spatially localized to a given atom or functional group. The concepts introduced in this article are applied to the Rydberg-type transitions observed in the electronic excitation of a nonbonding electron in formaldehyde and ammonia. The atomic partitioning of the molecular density distribution and of the molecular properties by surfaces of zero ﬂux in the gradient vector ﬁeld of the electron density, the boundary condition deﬁning the physics of a proper open system, is found to apply to the density distributions of the excited, Rydberg states.",

	abstract = "Every property of a molecule is given by the sum of the contributions from each of its constituent atoms or groups, the groups being defined as proper open systems. The observation of “experimental group additivty” requires that in addition to the properties of the groups being additive, the group and its properties be transferable from one molecule to another, different molecule. It is shown that such transferability of a group and its properties is in general, only apparent, being the result of compensatory transferability wherein the changes in the properties of one group are compensated for by equal but opposite changes in the properties of the adjoining group. These compensating changes are in some cases vanishingly small, but even when the energy changes are in excess of 20 kcal/mol, the experimental heat of formation is still predicted to be additive to within 0.1 kcal/mol. The operation of compensatory transferability is illustrated for the linear homologous series of hydrocarbons and polysilanes and for the formation of pyridine from fragments of benzene and pyrazine. The properties considered are the energy and the delocalization of the electrons, the former determined by the one-electron density matrix and the latter by the pair density. It is shown that the transferability of the degree of localization of the electrons to a given group, a property of the pair density, is a result of the conservation of the delocalization of its electrons over the remaining groups in the molecule. The results presented here emphasize the important observation that all the properties of a proper open systemsa functional groupswhether determined by the first-order density matrix, the pair density, or field-induced charge and current densities, are all functionally related to its form in real space, that is, to its distribution of charge.",

The system models “filled polymers”, which contain not only a blend of different macromolecules, but also solid fillers. We focus on the case where one of the components preferentially wets the surface of the particles. By combining a mesoscopic, coarse-grained description of the fluids with a discrete model for the particles, we show that the addition of hard particles significantly changes both the speed and the morphology of the phase separation. To probe the late-stage properties of the system, we also develop a mean-field rate-equation model for the mixture. The results indicate that the phase separation is arrested in the late stage; the “steady-state” domain size depends strongly on both the particle diffusion constant and the particle concentration. To obtain insight into the effects of processing on the properties of such composites, we also investigated the behavior of the binary fluid/particle mixture under shear. For sufficiently large particle densities, we find that the anisotropic growth caused by the imposed shear is destroyed by the randomly moving particles, and the domains are isotropic in shape even for large shear strains. Finally, we apply our models to mixtures of diblock copolymers and fillers. Overall, our findings reveal how the solid additives can be used to tailor the morphology of the complex mixture, and thereby control the macroscopic properties (such as mechanical integrity) of the composite.",

This result supports the application of the systematic search technique to larger model systems. The general features of the amiloridebase and amiloridebase pair intermolecular potential energy surfaces were found to be different in the case of adenine and thymine compared to guanine and cytosine, resulting in more orientational and translational freedom for amiloride in the former case. In addition, the interaction of amiloride with adenine and thymine nucleobases is significantly more dispersion-controlled than that with guanine and cytosine, where the electrostatic energy contributes up to a third of the total intermolecular energy. Amiloride in the base pair complexes is overlapped with guanine and adenine.

Considerable progress has been achieved toward understanding the nature of these interactions at the fundamental level. Ab initio theory has played a central role in this progress. The earlier applications of ab initio techniques to this problem concentrated primarily on the qualitative understanding of these interactions. These applications greatly benefited from the partitioning of interaction energy into its fundamental components, such as electrostatic, exchange, induction, and dispersion. The analyses of a large number of model complexes helped to identify the origins of binding and the sources of anisotropy of these interactions. A detailed examination of the interaction energy components and their computational requirements shed new light on the question of how to saturate the basis-set and the correlation effects. Progress in computational capabilities enabled the use of sufficiently large basis sets and highly correlated methods. With the background of these advances, the ab initio theory of intermolecular interactions entered a new quantitative phase. The progress in the accurate predictions of potential-energy surfaces for these interactions has been matched by new treatments of multidimensional fully coupled vibration dynamics, thereby establishing a direct connection to experimental observations.",

Thermal denaturation experiments show that the core duplex (lacking X) is formed with a free energy (37 degrees C) of -8.1 kcal mol(-1) in a pH 7.0 buffer containing 1 M Na+ We studied the effects of adding single dangling nucleosides (X) where the aromatic “base” is adenine, guanine, thymine, cytosine, pyrrole, benzene, 4-methylindole, 5-nitroindole, trimethylbenzene, difluorotoluene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, and pyrene. Adding these dangling residues is found to stabilize the duplex by an additional -0.8 to -3.4 kcal mol(-1). At 5 mu M DNA concentration, T-m values range from 41.7 degrees C (core sequence) to 64.1 degrees C (with dangling pyrene residues). For the four natural bases, the order of stacking ability is A > G greater than or equal to T = C. The nonpolar analogues stack more strongly in general than the more polar natural bases. The stacking geometry was confirmed in two cases (X = adenine and pyrene) by 2-D NOESY experiments. Also studied is the effect of ethanol cosolvent on the stacking of natural bases and pyrene. Stacking abilities were compared to calculated values for hydrophobicity, dipole moment, polarizability, and surface area. In general, hydrophobic effects are found to be larger than other effects stabilizing stacking (electrostatic effects, dispersion forces); however, the natural DNA bases are found to be less dependent on hydrophobic effects than are the more nonpolar compounds. The results also point out strategies for the design nucleoside analogues that stack considerably more strongly than the natural bases; such compounds may be useful in stabilizing designed DNA structures and complexes.",

Over the past 10 years there has been an increase in the number of rigorous biophysical studies of DNA-drug interactions and considerable insight has been gained into the energetics of these binding reactions. The advent of high-sensitivity calorimetric techniques has meant that the energetics of DNA-drug association reactions can be probed directly and enthalpic and entropic contributions to the binding free energy established, There are two principal consequences arising from this type of work, firstly three-dimensional structures of DNA-drug complexes from X-ray and NMR studies can be put into a thermodynamic context and the energetics responsible for stabilizing the observed structures can be more fully understood. Secondly, any rational approach to structure-based drug design requires a fundamental base of knowledge where structural detail and thermodynamic data on complex formation are intimately linked. Therefore these types of studies allow a set of general guidelines to be established, which can then be used to develop drug design algorithms. In this review we describe recent breakthroughs in duplex DNA-directed drug design and also discuss how similar principles are now being used to target higher-order DNA molecules, for example, tripler (three-stranded) and tetraplex (four-stranded) structures.

A range of interactions is considered: from closed-shell with and without charge transfer, through polar-shared, to equally shared interactions. The changes in the density are monitored in terms of the properties of the density at the bond critical point and the shape of the interatomic surface. The effect of these changes on the properties of the atoms defined as proper open systems is determined. The harpoon mechanism operative in the formation of {LiF} is found to exert dramatic effects on the electron density and on the atomic and molecular properties. The virial and the Ehrenfest force theorems in their molecular, atomic, and local forms, together with the {HellmannFeynman} theorem, provide an understanding of the similarities and differences in the bonding resulting from closed-shell, shared, and polar interactions. The effect of the long-range dispersion forces on the electron density and the resulting changes in the kinetic and potential energies, the former decreasing and the latter increasing on the initial approach of the atoms, are investigated. In addition to the changes in the total energy and its kinetic and potential energy components as a function of the internuclear separation R, the atomic contributions to these quantities are also reported. The atomic Ehrenfest force is the force acting on the electron density in an atomic basin and the one measured in an atomic force microscope. It is shown to change from an intially attractive interaction, to a repulsive one at a separation slightly greater than Re where the {HellmannFeynman} forces on the nuclei vanish.",

In the DDFT model a polymer is represented as a chain of springs and beads. A spring mimics the stretching behavior of a chain fragment and the spring constant is calculated with the Gaussian chain approximation. Simulations were always started from a homogeneous system. We have mainly investigated the ﬁnal morphology, adopted by the system. First, we have studied the bulk behavior. The diblock copolymer forms a hexagonal packed array of A-rich cylinders, embedded in a B-rich matrix. Film calculations have been done by conﬁning a polymer melt in a slit. Both the slit width and surface-polymer interactions were varied. With the outcomes a phase diagram for conﬁned ﬁlms has been constructed. Various phases are predicted: parallel cylinders (C ), perpendicular cylinders (C ), parallel lamellae (L ), and parallel perforated lamellae (CL ). When the ﬁlm surfaces are preferentially wet by either the A or the B block, parallel oriented microdomains are preferred. A perpendicular cylindrical phase is stable when neither the A nor B block preferentially wets the surfaces. The predicted phase diagram is in accordance with experimental data in the literature and explains the experimentally observed differences between ﬁlms of asymmetric block copolymers with only two parameters: the ﬁlm thickness and the energetic preference of the surface for one of the polymer blocks. We have also observed, that conﬁnement speeds up the process of long range ordering of the microdomains",

Such analytical techniques can usefully augment conventional drug design methods, particularly where detailed structural information is unavailable or the mode of binding to form a persistent DNA biotarget-ligand complex is not established. Examples from the author's laboratory are used to illustrate structure-specific (or structure-preferential) recognition and subsequent stabilization of DNA triplexes using intercalative or groove-mediated binding mechanisms, and the successful targeting of DNA tetraplexes using planar extended-aromatic ligands. in each case, chemical manipulation of the molecule by exploiting either (i) geometric isomers, (ii) redistribution of charged groups and/or H-bond donors/acceptors, or (iii) optimization of intermolecular pi-overlap can be used to improve the affinity or specificity of the underlying DNA-drug binding events.",

A persistent, slowly decaying ringing pattern in the C$\_2$ energy series was tracked out to MP155. Finally, new energy series were generated and analyzed through MP167 for Cl$^{-}$ and MP39 for Ar and HCl. The MP$n$ energy and property series variously display rapid or slow convergence, monotonic or oscillatory decay, highly erratic or regular behavior, or early or late divergence, all depending on the chemical system or the choice of one-particle basis set.

	abstract = "The theory of {Atoms-In-Molecules} {(AIM)} is a partitioning of the real space of a molecule into disjoint atomic constituents as determined by the topology of the electron density, rho(r). This theory identifies an atom in a molecule with a quantum mechanical open system and, consequently, all of the atom's properties are unambiguously defined. {AIM} recovers the basic empirical cornerstone of chemistry: that atoms and functional groups possess characteristic and additive properties that in many cases exhibit a remarkable transferability between different molecules. As a result, the theory enables the theoretical synthesis of a large molecule and the prediction of its properties by joining fragments that are predetermined as open systems. The present article is the first of a series (in preparation) that explore this possibility for polypeptides by determining the transferability of the building blocks: the amino acid residues. Transferability of group properties requires transferability of the electron density rho(r), which in turn requires the transferability of the geometric parameters. This article demonstrates that these parameters are conformation-insensitive for a representative amino acid, leucine, and that the atomic and bond properties exhibit a corresponding transferability. The effects of hydrogen bonding are determined and a set of geometrical conditions for the occurrence of such bonding is identified. The effects of transforming neutral leucine into its zwitter-ionic form on its atomic and bond properties are shown to be localized primarily to the sites of ionization.",

The key of this scheme is the deﬁnition and the full optimization of the diabatic state wave function, where the charge transfer among interacting molecules is deactivated. The present energy decomposition ED , BLW-ED, method is similar to the Morokuma decomposition scheme in deﬁnition of the energy terms, but differs in implementation and the computational algorithm. In addition, in the BLW-ED approach, the basis set superposition error is fully taken into account. The application of this scheme to the water dimer and the lithium cation–water clusters reveals that there is minimal charge transfer effect in hydrogen-bonded complexes. At the HF/aug-cc-PVTZ level, the electrostatic, polarization, and charge-transfer effects contribute 65\%, 24\%, and 11\%, respectively, to the total bonding energy 3.84 kcal/mol in the water dimer. On the other hand, charge transfer effects are shown to be signiﬁcant in Lewis acid–base complexes such as H3NSO3 and H3NBH3. In this work, the effect of basis sets used on the energy decomposition analysis is addressed and the results manifest that the present energy decomposition scheme is stable with a modest size of basis functions.",

	abstract = "Fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) is a mammalian integral membrane enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis of a number of neuromodulatory fatty acid amides, including the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide and the sleep-inducing lipid oleamide. FAAH belongs to a large class of hydrolytic enzymes termed the “amidase signature family,” whose members are defined by a conserved stretch of approximately 130 amino acids termed the “amidase signature sequence.” Recently, site-directed mutagenesis studies of FAAH have targeted a limited number of conserved residues in the amidase signature sequence of the enzyme, identifying Ser-241 as the catalytic nucleophile and Lys-142 as an acid/base catalyst. The roles of several other conserved residues with potentially important and/or overlapping catalytic functions have not yet been examined. In this study, we have mutated all potentially catalytic residues in FAAH that are conserved among members of the amidase signature family, and have assessed their individual roles in catalysis through chemical labeling and kinetic methods. Several of these residues appear to serve primarily structural roles, as their mutation produced FAAH variants with considerable catalytic activity but reduced expression in prokaryotic and/or eukaryotic systems. In contrast, five mutations, K142A, S217A, S218A, S241A, and R243A, decreased the amidase activity of FAAH greater than 100-fold without detectably impacting the structural integrity of the enzyme. The pH rate profiles, amide/ester selectivities, and fluorophosphonate reactivities of these mutants revealed distinct catalytic roles for each residue. Of particular interest, one mutant, R243A, displayed uncompromised esterase activity but severely reduced amidase activity, indicating that the amidase and esterase efficiencies of FAAH can be functionally uncoupled. Collectively, these studies provide evidence that amidase signature enzymes represent a large class of serine-lysine catalytic dyad hydrolases whose evolutionary distribution rivals that of the catalytic triad superfamily.",

Published van’t Hoff plots were reanalyzed to obtain ∆Cp values of -337 to -423 cal mol-1 K-1 for the binding of actinomycin D to several DNA oligonucleotide duplexes with defined sequences. Heat capacity changes for DNA intercalation were found to correlate with the alterations in solvent-accessible surface area calculated from available high-resolution structural data.

The ∆Cp terms were used to estimate the hydrophobic contribution to intercalative binding free energies, yielding values that ranged from -11.2 (ethidium) to -30 kcal mol-1 (actinomycin D). An attempt was made to parse the observed binding free energies of ethidium and propidium into five underlying contributions.

While it has been previously shown that a change in the polarization of a dielectric can be considered a consequence of a geometric quantum phase and obtainable from a Berry phase in a parameter space, such a possibility does not exclude a real space description, stated in terms of the charge distributions of the system's composite atoms or cells. The cells are defined as bounded regions of real space whose properties are described by the physics of a proper open system, a description that applies to any system regardless of the nature of the interactions between the atoms. This approach necessarily leads to the inclusion of a contribution to the polarization arising from the transfer of charge across the boundary of a cell, in addition to that from the cell's internal polarization, thereby correcting the textbook description of polarization that considers only the latter contribution. It is shown that a neutral repeating cell in a dielectric behaves as an atomic capacitor which mimics the macroscopic behavior, with the internal charge transfer leading to the creation of what Feynman terms the ldquosurface polarization charge.rdquo © 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

Intercalating agents share common structural features such as the presence of planar polyaromatic systems which bind by insertion between DNA base-pairs, with a marked preference for 5'-pyrimidine-purine-3' steps. The chromophores are linked to basic chains that might also play an important role in the affinity and selectivity shown by these compounds. Bisintercalators have two potential intercalating ring systems connected by linkers which can vary in length and rigidity. Nowadays it is well accepted that the antitumor activity of intercalators is closely related to the ability of these compounds to stabilize the DNA-intercalator-topoisomerase II ternary complex. In this work we have carried out a revision of small organic molecules that bind to the DNA molecule via intercalation, and exert their antitumor activity through a proven topoisomerase II inhibition. We have tried to give a general overview of the most recent results in this area, paying special attention to compounds that are currently under clinical trials.

In recent years, the crystal structures of a number of topoisomerase fragments, representing nearly all the known classes of enzymes, have been solved. These structures provide remarkable insights into the mechanisms of these enzymes and complement previous conclusions based on biochemical analyses. Surprisingly, despite little or no sequence homology, both type IA and type ITA topoisomerases from prokaryotes and the type IIA enzymes from eukaryotes share structural folds that appear to reflect functional motifs within critical regions of the enzymes. The type IB enzymes are structurally distinct from all other known topoisomerases but are similar to a class of enzymes referred to as tyrosine recombinases. The structural themes common to all topoisomerases include hinged clamps that open and close to bind DNA, the presence of DNA binding cavities for temporary storage of DNA segments, and the coupling of protein conformational changes to DNA rotation or DNA movement.

	abstract = "The medicinal properties of marijuana have been recognized for centuries, but clinical and societal acceptance of this drug of abuse as a potential therapeutic agent remains ﬁercely debated. An attractive alternative to marijuana-based therapeutics would be to target the molecular pathways that mediate the effects of this drug. To date, these neural signaling pathways have been shown to comprise a cannabinoid receptor (CB1) that binds the active constituent of marijuana, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and a postulated endogenous CB1 ligand anandamide. Although anandamide binds and activates the CB1 receptor in vitro, this compound induces only weak and transient cannabinoid behavioral effects in vivo, possibly a result of its rapid catabolism. Here we show that mice lacking the enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH / ) are severely impaired in their ability to degrade anandamide and when treated with this compound, exhibit an array of intense CB1-dependent behavioral responses, including hypomotility, analgesia, catalepsy, and hypothermia. FAAH / -mice possess 15-fold augmented endogenous brain levels of anandamide and display reduced pain sensation that is reversed by the CB1 antagonist SR141716A. Collectively, these results indicate that FAAH is a key regulator of anandamide signaling in vivo, setting an endogenous cannabinoid tone that modulates pain perception. FAAH may therefore represent an attractive pharmaceutical target for the treatment of pain and neuropsychiatric disorders.",

Considering that there are only three major biopolymer backbones (proteins, ribonucleic acids, and polysaccharides), nature vividly teaches that copolymer sequence is a powerful way to meet diverse chemical challenges. It is logical then to ask are biomacromolecule building blocks are matchless in their suitability for life? Systematic studies on alternative monomers closely related to those found in nature have provided clues about the fitness of R-amino acids, ribofuranosyl (5′f3′) nucleic acids, and phosphodiester linkages. Yet “why nature is such, and not otherwise”1 is a question that continues to be asked. Looking beyond the biopolymers and their related derivatives however, it is possible to imagine that other chain molecules are capable of similar functions. This prediction has only recently begun to be tested, raising questions of great fundamental interest. On a more practical level, the discovery of new functional polymers clearly has widespread potential for both chemistry and biology.",

Molecular recognition processes are inﬂuenced by many diﬀerent factors which make their study complicated. Progress requires a quantitative understanding of these diﬀerent factors. Some key functional group interactions, such as H-bonding, are well-understood. H-bonds are strong, single point interactions with a very well-deﬁned geometry, and their magnitude is determined by the electrostatic forces between the donor hydrogen atom and the acceptor atom. For weaker, less well-deﬁned interactions, the picture is not so clear. In this review, we focus on one such class, aromatic interactions. Here there are multiple points of intermolecular contact, the geometry of interaction is variable, and there are a vast range of diﬀerent functional groups that can be involved. We summarise evidence on the properties of these interactions from a variety of diﬀerent sources, and we apologise for necessarily omitting related work.",

The geometry of the concerted Diels-Alder TS for ethylene and butadiene becomes more compact upon CP-correction, whereas the apparent TS for the 1,2-H-atom shift in ethyl radical is shown to be an artifact of BSSE (at least at the HF and DFT levels).

Common features involve base-stacking and pairing of complementary bases via H-bonded interactions, although a wide variety of pairing motifs are found in higher-order structures. Another property is the marked flexibility of nucleic acids reflected in their solution behaviour, thermodynamic stability and interactions with proteins and small ligand molecules. The electrostatic properties of a nucleic acid and its ability to pack into high-order structure(s) are largely determined by the anionic phosphodiester backbone. This feature is particularly evident for triple-helical assemblies, where there is close proximity between phosphates and intrinsic thermodynamic stability is strongly influenced by ionic strength. Structural stabilisation of parallel triplexes can also be modulated by the presence of positive charge, achieved through either N3-protonation of cytosine bases or the deliberate incorporation of charged residues into the third strand. Salt effects are also pronounced in four-stranded structures such as the i-motif and G-tetraplex (“quadruplex”) assemblies; indeed, different structures are produced for the latter depending on the nature of the associated cation.

The present study provides evidence that the experimental data for the 3-atom-linked bis-adenyl and bis-naphthyl compounds are consistent with the theory indicating that nonelectrostatic interactions drive adenine stacking. First, a theoretical conformational analysis is found to reproduce the observed ranking of the stacking tendencies of the compounds studied experimentally. A geometric analysis identifies two possible reasons, other than stronger electrostatic interactions, why the 3-atom-linked bis-adenyl compounds should stack more than the bis-naphthyl compounds. First, stacked naphthyl groups tend to lie further apart: than stacked adenyl groups, based upon both quantum calculations and crystal structures. This may prevent the bis-naphthyl compound from stacking as extensively as the bis-adenyl compound. Second, geometric analysis shows that more stacked conformations are sterically accessible to the bis-adenyl compound than to the bis-naphthyl compound because the linker is attached to the sides of the adenyl groups, but to the ends of the naphthyl groups. Finally, ab initio quantum mechanics calculations and energy decompositions for relevant conformations of adenine and naphthalene dimers support the view that stacking in these compounds is driven primarily by nonelectrostatic interactions. The present analysis illustrates the importance of considering all aspects of a molecular system when interpreting experimental data, and the value of computer models as an adjunct to chemical intuition.",

Such an assumption is a reflection of a trivial observation that if monomer degrees of freedom are considered, the dimensionality of an intermolecular potential increases dramatically even for few-atom monomers. This puts strict limits on the sizes of clusters with flexible monomers that can be treated by ab initio methods since the number of grid points needed to fit a potential surface quickly becomes enormous. Most of the literature flexible-monomer potentials were obtained from the so-called site-site rigid-monomer potentials by simply allowing the sites to move with atomic nuclei as the monomers are deformed. This simple atom-following approach has been investigated in the present work, using water dimer and Ar-HF as test systems, and shown to be not adequate. A method has been proposed which uses properties of isolated flexible monomers to improve upon the atom-following approach without performing any dimer calculations outside the rigid-monomer grid. The method is shown to give for Ar-HF a 3D representation of the dispersion energy that should be adequate for HF motion in the ground and first excited vibrational states.",

	abstract = "This is the first reported use of a hybrid method involving density functional theory {(DFT)} and symmetry-adapted perturbation theory {(SAPT)} to calculate intermolecular interactions. This work was stimulated by the reported failures of supermolecular {DFT} calculations to adequately predict intermolecular (and interatomic) interactions, particularly of the van der Waals type. The goals are to develop a hybrid scheme that will calculate intermolecular interaction energies accurately and in a computationally efficient fashion, while including the benefits of the energy decomposition provided by {SAPT.} The computational savings result from replacing the costly perturbation theory treatment with {DFT,} which should include the intramolecular correlation effects on the intermolecular interaction energies. The accuracy of this new hybrid approach (labeled {SAPT(DFT))} is evaluated by comparisons with higher level calculations. The test cases include He2, Ar2, {ArH2,} {(H2O)2,} {(HF)2,} {CO2CH3CN,} and {CO2-dimethylnitramine.} The new approach shows mixed results concerning the accuracy of interaction energies. {SAPT(DFT)} correctly predicts all the qualitative trends in binding energies for all test cases. This is particularly encouraging in dimer systems dominated by dispersive interactions where supermolecular {DFT} fails to predict binding. In addition, the method achieves a drastic reduction (a factor of at least 100) in computational time over the higher level calculations often used to predict these forces. With respect to quantitative accuracy, this initial hybrid scheme, using the very popular exchange-correlation functional {B3LYP,} overestimates the second-order energy components (e.g., induction and dispersion terms) for all of the test cases, and subsequently overestimates the total interaction energy for all dimer systems except those heavily dominated by the electrotstatic interactions. The {SAPT} energy decomposition points to the use of {DFT} virtual orbital eigenvalues in the second-order perturbation terms as the likely cause for this error. These results are consistent with earlier work suggesting that {DFT} canonical virtual orbital energies obtained from commonly used functionals are less than optimal for use in such a perturbative scheme. The first-order interaction energy terms from the {SAPT(DFT)} are found to be generally more accurate than the second-order terms, and agree well with the benchmark values for dimers containing molecules with a permanent electric dipole moment. These first-order terms depend only upon the occupied {MO} eigenvectors, and hence are not affected by the inaccuracies in the {KohnSham} {DFT} virtual orbital eigenvalues. These observations encourage future studies utilizing newly reported functionals, some of which have been developed to directly address problems with {DFT} virtual orbital energies and the asymptotic region of the electron density.",

These compounds are all substrates for the same hydrolytic enzyme, fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), whose molecular characterization was obtained in 1996.

The majority of applications of polymeric materials is based on their excellent mechanical properties, which arise from the long-chain nature of the constituents. Microscopically, this means that polymeric materials are able to respond to external forces in a broad frequency range, i.e., with a broad range of relaxation processes. Computer simulation methods are ideally suited to help to understand these processes and the structural properties that lead to them and to further our ability to predict materials properties and behavior. However, the broad range of timescales and underlying structure prohibits any one single simulation method from capturing all of these processes.

Therefore, these biomolecules represent a major target in drug development strategies designed to produce next generation therapeutics for diseases such as cancer. In order to improve the clinical efficacy of existing drugs and also to design new ones it is necessary to understand the molecular basis of drug-DNA interactions in structural, thermodynamic, and kinetic detail. The past decade has witnessed an increase in the number of rigorous biophysical studies of drug-DNA systems and considerable knowledge has been gained in the energetics of these binding reactions. This is, in part, due to the increased availability of high-sensitivity calorimetric techniques, which have allowed the thermodynamics of drug-DNA interactions to be probed directly and accurately. The focus of this article is to review thermodynamic approaches to examining drug-DNA recognition. Specifically, an overview of a recently developed method of analysis that dissects the binding free energy of these reactions into five component terms is presented. The results of applying this analysis to the DNA binding interactions of both minor groove drugs and intercalators are discussed. The solvent water plays a key role in nucleic acid structure and consequently in the binding of ligands to these biomolecules. Any rational approach to DNA-targeted drug design requires an understanding of how water participates in recognition and binding events. Recent studies examining hydration changes that accompany DNA binding by intercalators will be reviewed. Finally some aspects of cooperativity in drug-DNA interactions are described and the importance of considering cooperative effects when examining these reactions is highlighted.

Complete basis set MP2 (CBS MP2) stacking energies extrapolated using aug-cc-pVXZ (X = D, T, and for pyrimidine dimer Q) basis sets equal to -5.3, -12.3, and -11.2 kcal/mol for the first three dimers, respectively. Higher-order correlation corrections estimated as the difference between MP2 and CCSD(T) stacking energies amount to 2.0, 0.7, and 0.9 kcal/mol and lead to final estimates of the genuine stacking energies for the three dimers of -3.4, -11.6, and -10.4 kcal/mol. The CBS MP2 stacking-energy estimate for guanine dimer (-14.8 kcal/mol) was based on the 6-31G*(0.25) and aug-cc-pVDZ calculations. This simplified extrapolation can be routinely used with a meaningful accuracy around 1 kcal/mol for large aromatic stacking clusters. The final estimate of the guanine stacking energy after the CCSD(T) correction amounts to - 12.9 kcal/mol. The MP2/6-31G*(0.25) method previously used as the standard level to calculate aromatic stacking in hundreds of geometries of nucleobase dimers systematically underestimates the base stacking by ca. 1.0-2.5 kcal/mol per stacked dimer, covering 75-90\% of the intermolecular correlation stabilization. We suggest that this correction is to be considered in calibration of force fields and other cheaper computational methods. The quality of the MP2/6-31G*(0.25) predictions is nevertheless considerably better than suggested on the basis of monomer polarizability calculations. Fast and very accurate estimates of the MP2 aromatic stacking energies can be achieved using the Rl-MP2 method. The CBS MP2 calculations and the CCSD(T) correction, when taken together, bring only marginal changes to the relative stability of H-bonded and stacked base pairs, with a slight shift of ca. 1 kcal/mol in favor of H-bonding. We suggest that the present values are very close to ultimate predictions of the strength of aromatic base stacking of DNA and RNA bases.",

High- order electrostatic moments are computed within the compact spherical tensor formalism from ab initio wave functions of rigid geometry- optimized monomers. When combined with a simple hard- sphere or Lennard- Jones potential this topological electrostatic interaction potential correctly predicts the geometries of 27 DNA base- pairs. With the Lennard- Jones( LJ) potential internuclear distances of frontier atoms between base- pairs differ only by 0.08 Angstrom compared to supermolecular calculations at B3LYP/ 6- 31G( d, p) level. The discrepancy for angles involved in hydrogen bond contacts amounts to only 3.5degrees. The topological model globally reproduces the correct ranking in intermolecular interaction energy (6.5 +/- 6.5 kJ mol(-1)). Subsequently we compare the interaction energy profiles of the topological model with distributed multipole analysis, Merz-Kollman charges and the natural population analysis at the B3LYP/ 6- 311+ G( 2d, p) level. The convergence of the topological multipole expansion is somewhat more favorable than that based on DMA but the two models have similar basis set dependence.

Here we demonstrate the ability of single molecule force spectroscopy to discriminate between different interaction modes by measuring the mechanical properties of DNA and their modulation upon the binding of small molecules. Due to the unique topology of double stranded DNA and due to its base pair stacking pattern, DNA undergoes several well-characterised structural transitions upon stretching. We show that small molecule binding markedly affects these transitions in ways characteristic to the binding mode and that these effects can be detected at the level of an individual molecule.

The theoretical contributions to this effort are largely attributed to mean-ﬁeld calculations on a standard Gaussian model. Here, we review this present understanding of block copolymer phase behaviour, the model and its underlying assumptions, the mean-ﬁeld approximation and its limitations, and the attempts to incorporate ﬂuctuation corrections. Rather than following the traditional rigorous derivations, we present slightly more intuitive and transparent ones in such a way to stress the close connection between the related calculations.

A detailed comparison showed the calculated geometries to be in excellent agreement with those determined by X-ray crystallography. The study demonstrated that the geometric parameters for the main-chain group and for the bonds and common functional groups of the side-chains exhibit a high degree of transferability among the members of this set of molecules. This geometric transferability is a necessary prerequisite for the corresponding transferability of their electron density distributions and hence of their bond and atomic properties. The transferability of the electron distributions will be demonstrated and exploited in the following paper of this series, which uses the topology of the electron density to define an atom within the quantum theory of atoms in molecules. Particular features of the geometries of the amino acids are discussed. It has been shown, for example, how the apparent anomaly of the {Calpha\&bond;N} bond length in a peptide being shorter than in the charged species {Calpha\&bond;NH+3} is resolved when the charge separation is gauged by the differences in the charges of the Calpha and N atoms as opposed to the use of formal charges. A compilation of literature sources on experimental geometries covering each member of the 20 amino acids is presented. A set of rules for labeling the atoms and bonds, complementing the generally accepted {IUPAC-IUB} rules, is proposed to uniquely identify every atom and bond in the amino acids.",

All intercalators exhibit large charge delocalization, and none of them (including the DAPI dication) exhibits a site with dominant charge. All intercalators have large polarizability and are good electron acceptors, while base pairs are good electron donors. MP2/6-31G*(0.25) stabilization energies of intercalator(...)base pair complexes are large (E(...)AT, 22.4 kcal/mol; D(...)GC, 17.8 kcal/mol; EL(...)GC, 18.2 kcal/mol; DAPI(...)GC, 21.1 kcal/mol) and are well reproduced by modified AMBER potential (van der Waals radii of intercalator atoms are enlarged and their energy depths are increased). Standard AMBER potential underestimates binding, especially for DAPI-containing complexes. Because the DAPI dication is the best electron acceptor (among all intercalators studied), this difference is explained by the importance of the charge-transfer term, which is not included in the AMBER potential. For the neutral EL molecule, the standard AMBER force field provides correct results. The Hartree-Fock and DFT/B3LYP methods, not covering the dispersion energy, fail completely to reveal any energy minimum at the potential energy curve of the E(...)AT complex, and these methods thus cannot be recommended for a study of intercalation process. On the other hand, an approximate version of the DFT method, which was extended to cover London dispersion energy, yields for all complexes very good stabilization energies that are well comparable with referenced ab initio data. Besides the vertical dependence of the interaction, an energy twist dependence of the interaction energy was also investigated by a reference correlated ab initio method and empirical potentials. It is concluded that, despite the cationic (E + 1, D + 1, DAPI + 2) or polar (EL) character of the intercalators investigated, it is the dispersion energy which predominantly contributes to the stability of intercalator(...)DNA base pair complexes. Any procedure which does not cover dispersion energy is thus not suitable for studying the process of intercalation.",

Then we provide an overview of key electronic properties of standard and selected modified nucleobases, such as their charge distributions, dipole moments, polarizabilities, proton affinities, tautomeric equilibria, and amino group hybridization. Then we continue with hydrogen bonding of nucleobases, by analyzing energetics of standard basepairs,yI mismatched base pairs, thio-base pairs, and others. After this, the nature of aromatic stacking interactions is explained. Also, nonclassical interactions in nucleic acids such as interstrand bifurcated hydrogen bonds, interstrand close amino group contacts, C-H... O interbase contacts, sugars base stacking, intrinsically nonplanar base pairs, out-of-plane hydrogen bonds, and amino-acceptor interactions are commented on.

On the other hand, AIM and Chelpg results display the best linear correlation coefﬁcients with the experimental data. Since reasonably accurate Chelpg results could be already obtained with SCF or DFT B3LYP methods using cc-pVDZ, such an approach opens the way to study intermolecular charge transfer in larger molecular systems. Preliminary results obtained within cc-pVDZ basis set and B3LYP functional for pyridine-SO3 complex do not exceed relative error limits observed for other smaller complexes. Analysis of corresponding interaction energy components calculated consistently in the dimer basis set indicates signiﬁcant role of electrostatic, exchange and delocalization contributions, with rather negligible correlation term. In contrast to previous ﬁndings, the experimentally observed amount of transferred charge seems not to correlate with any interaction energy term.",

Predicting the morphologies of these systems is difficult because the final structures depend not only on the characteristics of the copolymer but also on the features of the particles. Combining self-consistent field and density functional theories, we develop a model that allows us to determine the equilibrium or metastable phases of diblock copolymer/spherical nanoparticle composites, without making a priori assumptions about the structure of the system. Using this model, we illustrate various examples where mixtures of diblocks and nanoparticles self-assemble into mesoscopically ordered phases. The model can be generalized to other types of copolymers and particles and can be modified to include homopolymers or solvent molecules. Thus, the technique constitutes a useful tool for determining the structures of a large class of nanocomposites.",

Using a triple-zeta basis set with two sets of polarization functions augmented with higher angular momentum and diffuse functions [TZ2P(f,d)+dif], the fully optimized geometries and harmonic vibrational frequencies of these ten stationary points were determined at the CCSD(T) theoretical level. In agreement with other ab initio investigations, only one of these ten stationary points is a true minimum. Of the other nine structures, three are transition structures, and the remaining are higher order saddle points. These high-level ab initio results indicate that the lowest lying transition state involved in hydrogen interchange is chiral, of C-1 symmetry rather than C-s as suggested by recently developed 6D potential energy surfaces. The one- and n-particle limits of the electronic energies of these ten stationary points were probed by systematic variation of the atomic orbital basis sets and the treatment of electron correlation within the framework of the focal-point analysis of Allen and co-workers. The one-particle limit was approached via extrapolation of electronic energies computed with the augmented correlation consistent basis sets (aug-cc-pVXZ, X=D-6), and, independently, by estimating the basis set incompleteness effect with the explicitly-correlated second-order Møller–Plesset method (MP2-R12). Electron correlation was evaluated at levels as high as the Brueckner coupled cluster method with double excitations and perturbatively treated triple and quadruple excitations [BD(TQ)]. Core correlation and relativistic effects were also assessed. Consideration of the aforementioned electronic effects as well as basis set superposition error leads to an estimate of 21.0 kJ mol(-1) for the electronic dissociation energy of (H2O)(2).

For weakly segregated blocks and below a critical value of the field, Ec, surface interactions stabilize stacking of lamellae in a direction parallel to the surfaces. Above the critical field, a first-order phase transition occurs when lamellae in a direction perpendicular to the confining surfaces (and parallel to the field) become stable. The film morphology is then a superposition of parallel and perpendicular lamellae. In contrast to Helfrich-Hurault instability for smectic liquid crystals, the mode that gets critical first has the natural lamellar periodicity. In addition, undulations of adjacent intermaterial dividing surfaces are out-of-phase with each other. For diblock copolymers in the strong segregation regime, we find two critical fields E1 and E2 > E1. As the field is increased from zero above E1, the region in the middle of the film develops an orientation perpendicular to the walls, while the surface regions still have parallel lamellae. When the field is increased above E2, the perpendicular alignment spans the whole film. In another range of parameters, the transition from parallel to perpendicular orientation is direct.",

The calculated interaction energies of the parallel, T-shaped and slipped-parallel benzene dimers are -1.48, -2.46, and -2.48 kcal/mol, respectively, The substantial attractive interaction in benzene dimer, even where the molecules are well separated, shows that the major source of attraction is not short-range interactions such as charge-transfer but long-range interactions such as electrostatic and dispersion. The inclusion of electron correlation increases attraction significantly. The dispersion interaction is found to be the major source of attraction in the benzene dimer, The orientation dependence of the dimer interaction is mainly controlled by long-range interactions. Although electrostatic interaction is considerably weaker than dispersion interaction, it is highly orientation dependent.

This paper represents a preliminary investigation into the feasibility of examining such relatively large systems using atomistic modeling techniques. No attempt is made here to model any specific system. A generic linear polymer “united-atom” model is first created in an amorphous phase before the insertion of an atomistically detailed silica nanoparticle of diameter 4.4 nm. A novel method to insert a nanoparticle into a polymer matrix is given. The entire system is contained in a standard periodic simulation cell of side length ∼10 nm. The volume fraction of silica corresponded to 4.5\%. The composite system was subsequently relaxed at 300 K and at two different pressures using standard MD techniques, the gmq suite of programs being used for this purpose. Results are presented regarding the variation of the structure and dynamics of the system with respect to the distance from the polymer-nanoparticle interface and as a function of pressure. A clear structuring of the polymer chains around the nanoparticle is seen with prominent first and second peaks in the radial density function and a concurrent development of preferred chain orientation. The probability of trans conformers is also higher close to the interface and shows a distinct gradient. In contrast, evidence for chain immobilization is less obvious overall although dynamic properties are more sensitive to changes in the pressure.

Docking of ligands to the minor or major groove of {DNA} has the effect that the intramolecular {B-S} transition remains visible as a distinct plateau in the force-extension trace. By contrast, intercalation of small molecules into the double helix is characterized by the vanishing of the {B-S} plateau. These findings lead to the conclusion that atomic force microscope force spectroscopy can be regarded as a single molecule biosensor and is a potent tool for the characterization of binding motives of small ligands to {DNA.}",

Planar H-bonded structures of G(...)C, mG(...)mC, and A(...)T correspond to the Watson-Crick (WC) arrangement, in contrast to mA(...)mT for which the Hoogsteen (H) structure is found. Stabilization energies for all structures were determined as the sum of the complete basis set limit of MP2 energies and a (DeltaE(CCSD(T)) - DeltaE(MP2)) correction term evaluated with the cc-pVDZ(0.25,0.15) basis set. The complete basis set limit of MP2 energies was determined by two-point extrapolation using the aug-cc-pVXZ basis sets for X = D and T and X = T and Q. This procedure is required since the convergency of the MP2 interaction energy for the present complexes is rather slow, and it is thus important to include the extrapolation to the complete basis set limit. For the MP2/aug-cc-pVQZ level of theory, stabilization energies for all complexes studied are already very close to the complete basis set limit. The much cheaper D–>T extrapolation provided a complete basis set limit close (by less than 0.7 kcal/mol) to the more accurate T–>Q term, and the D–>T extrapolation can be recommended for evaluation of complete basis set limits of more extended complexes (e.g. larger motifs of DNA). The convergency of the (DeltaE(CCSD(T)) - DeltaE(MP2)) term is known to be faster than that of the MP2 or CCSD(T) correlation energy itself, and the cc-pVDZ(0.25,0.15) basis set provides reasonable values for planar H-bonded as well as stacked structures. Inclusion of the CCSD(T) correction is essential for obtaining reliable relative values for planar H-bonding and stacking interactions; neglecting the CCSD(T) correction results in very considerable errors between 2.5 and 3.4 kcal/mol. Final stabilization energies (kcal/mol) for the base pairs studied are very substantial (A(...)T WC, 15.4; mA(...)mT H, 16.3; A(...)T stacked, 11.6; mA(...)mT stacked, 13.1; G(...)C WC, 28.8; mG(...)mC WC, 28.5; G(...)C stacked, 16.9; mG(...)mC stacked, 18.0), much larger than published previously. On the basis of comparison with experimental data, we conclude that our values represent the lower boundary of the true stabilization energies. On the basis of error analysis, we expect the present H-bonding energies to be fairly close to the true values, while stacked energies are still expected to be about 10\% too low. The stacking energy for the mG(...)mC pair is considerably lower than the respective H-bonding energy, but it is larger than the mA(...)mT H-bonding energy. This conclusion could significantly change the present view on the importance of specific H-bonding interactions and nonspecific stacking interactions in nature, for instance, in DNA. Present stabilization energies for H-bonding and stacking energies represent the most accurate and reliable values and can be considered as new reference data.",

We find that in such restricted geometries a polymer-induced depletion attraction drives the particles to these walls. If the particles are chemically distinct from the walls, they will effectively modify the chemical nature of these substrates. This change in chemistry, in turn, affects the polymer-wall interactions and consequently the structure of the film. We illustrate this point by considering mixtures of particles and symmetric diblocks and show that the confining walls can be exploited to promote the self-assembly of the system into particle nanowires that extend throughout the films and are separated by nanoscale stripes of polymer domains. Such films constitute vital components in the fabrication of nanoscale devices. Furthermore, the results point to a novel technique for modifying the chemical nature of coatings and films entirely through self-assembly. Since this technique relies on entropic effects, it constitutes a fairly robust method that can be applied more generally than approaches that rely primarily on chemistry-specific enthalpic effects.",

	abstract = "This article presents a study of the molecular charge distributions of the genetically encoded amino acids {(AA),} one that builds on the previous determination of their equilibrium geometries and the demonstrated transferability of their common geometrical parameters. The properties of the charge distributions are characterized and given quantitative expression in terms of the bond and atomic properties determined within the quantum theory of atoms-in-molecules {(QTAIM)} that defines atoms and bonds in terms of the observable charge density. The properties so defined are demonstrated to be remarkably transferable, a reflection of the underlying transferability of the charge distributions of the main chain and other groups common to the {AA.} The use of the atomic properties in obtaining an understanding of the biological functions of the {AA,} whether free or bound in a polypeptide, is demonstrated by the excellent statistical correlations they yield with experimental physicochemical properties. A property of the {AA} side chains of particular importance is the charge separation index {(CSI),} a quantity previously defined as the sum of the magnitudes of the atomic charges and which measures the degree of separation of positive and negative charges in the side chain of interest. The {CSI} values provide a correlation with the measured free energies of transfer of capped side chain analogues, from the vapor phase to aqueous solution, yielding a linear regression equation with r2 = 0.94. The atomic volume is defined by the van der Waals isodensity surface and it, together with the {CSI,} which accounts for the electrostriction of the solvent, yield a linear regression (r2 = 0.98) with the measured partial molar volumes of the {AAs.} The changes in free energies of transfer from octanol to water upon interchanging 153 pairs of {AAs} and from cyclohexane to water upon interchanging 190 pairs of {AAs,} were modeled using only three calculated parameters (representing electrostatic and volume contributions) yielding linear regressions with r2 values of 0.78 and 0.89, respectively. These results are a prelude to the single-site mutation-induced changes in the stabilities of two typical proteins: ubiquitin and staphylococcal nuclease. Strong quadratic correlations (r2 sim 0.9) were obtained between {DeltaCSI} upon mutation and each of the two terms {DeltaDeltaH} and {TDeltaDeltaS} taken from recent and accurate differential scanning calorimetry experiments on ubiquitin. When the two terms are summed to yield {DeltaDeltaG,} the quadratic terms nearly cancel, and the result is a simple linear fit between {DeltaDeltaG} and {DeltaCSI} with r2 = 0.88. As another example, the change in the stability of staphylococcal nuclease upon mutation has been fitted linearly (r2 = 0.83) to the sum of a {DeltaCSI} term and a term representing the change in the van der Waals volume of the side chains upon mutation. The suggested correlation of the polarity of the side chain with the second letter of the {AA} triplet genetic codon is given concrete expression in a classification of the side chains in terms of their {CSI} values and their group dipole moments. For example, all amino acids with a pyrimidine base as their second letter in {mRNA} possess side-chain {CSI} le 2.8 (with the exception of Cys), whereas all those with {CSI} \&gt; 2.8 possess an purine base. The article concludes with two proposals for measuring and predicting molecular complementarity: van der Waals complementarity expressed in terms of the van der Waals isodensity surface and Lewis complementarity expressed in terms of the local charge concentrations and depletions defined by the topology of the Laplacian of the electron density. A display of the experimentally accessible Laplacian distribution for a folded protein would offer a clear picture of the operation of the ldquostereochemical coderdquo proposed as the determinant in the folding process.",

The recent determination of the three-dimensional structures of {FAAH} and two distantly related bacterial amidase signature enzymes indicates that these enzymes employ an unusual serine-serine-lysine triad for catalysis {(Ser-241/Ser-217/Lys-142} in {FAAH).} Mutagenesis of each of the triad residues in {FAAH} has been shown to severely reduce amidase activity; however, how these residues contribute, both individually and in cooperation, to catalysis remains unclear. Here, through a combination of site-directed mutagenesis, enzyme kinetics, and chemical labeling experiments, we provide evidence that each {FAAH} triad residue plays a distinct role in catalysis. In particular, the mutation of Lys-142 to alanine indicates that this residue functions as both a base involved in the activation of the Ser-241 nucleophile and an acid that participates in the protonation of the substrate leaving group. This latter property appears to support the unusual ability of {FAAH} to hydrolyze amides and esters at equivalent rates. Interestingly, although structural evidence indicates that the impact of Lys-142 on catalysis probably occurs through the bridging Ser-217, the mutation of this latter residue to alanine impaired catalytic activity but left the amide/ester hydrolysis ratios of {FAAH} intact. Collectively, these findings suggest that {FAAH} possesses a specialized active site structure dedicated to a mechanism for competitive amide and ester hydrolysis where nucleophile attack and leaving group protonation occur in a coordinated manner dependent on Lys-142.",

A quantum mechanical study of the tautomeric equilibrium of histamine free-base in solution was performed at the 6-311G** level. Electronic correlation energies were included by using the hybrid functional B3LYP. The solvent was simulated as a continuum characterized by a dielectric constant, and the quantum system (solute) was placed in an ellipsoidal cavity. Solute-solvent electrostatic interaction was calculated by means a multipolar moment expansion introduced in the Hamiltonian. Four relevant histamine conformations were optimized by allowing all the geometrical parameters to vary independently, which involved both the gauche-trans and the N3H-N1H tautomerisms. The calculated free energies predicted N3H-gauche as the most stable one of histamine free-base in solution. The order of stability is here completely altered with respect to previous results in gas phase, which presented the N1H-gauche conformer as the most stable structure. Our results also differ from previous Monte Carlo simulations, which obtained the N3H-trans conformer as the most stable in solution, although in this case, the histamine structures were kept frozen to the gas-phase geometry. Vibrational spectroscopy results support theoretical ones. Quadratic force fields for the four histamine conformers were achieved under the same calculation methodology. Previously, a general assignment of the infrared and Raman spectra of histamine free-base was proposed for solutions in both natural and heavy water. This allowed us to compare the experimental set of both wavenumbers and infrared intensities with the calculated ones. The lowest quadratic mean wavenumber deviation was obtained for the N3H-gauche conformer, in agreement with the free-energy calculations. Calculated infrared intensities were also compared to the experimental intensities, supporting this conformer as the relevant structure of histamine free-base in solution. It was then selected for a complete vibrational dynamics calculation, starting with a low-level scaling procedure to fit the set of calculated wavenumbers to the experimental values. The results were presented in terms of quadratic force constants, potential energy distribution, and normal modes.",

Smectites are a valuable mineral class for industrial applications because of their high cation exchange capacities, surface area, surface reactivity, adsorptive properties, and, in the case of hectorite, high viscosity and transparency in solution. In their pristine form they are hydrophilic in nature, and this property makes them very difﬁcult to disperse into a polymer matrix.

TAE molecular surface distributions of electrostatic potentials are compared with analytical ab initio and empirical (Gasteiger) partial charge reference models for several conformations of test peptides. Surface electrostatic potential distributions computed using TAE multipole representations were found to converge at the octopole level, with incremental improvement observed when hexadecapoles were included. Molecular electrostatic potential ﬁelds that were produced using the TAE method were observed to be responsive to conformational changes and to compare well with ab initio reference distributions. Generation of TAE atom types and their associated multipoles does not involve ﬁtting to sample electrostatic potential ﬁelds, but rather utilizes integrated AIM atomic electron density distributions within representative chemical environments.

There has been intense interest in the DNA binding sequence specificity of these compounds in recent years, with the hope that a compound could be identified that could possibly modulate gene expression or exhibit reduced toxicity. To computationally analyze this phenomenon, we have constructed molecular models of 65 doxorubicin analogues and their complexes with eight distinct DNA octamer sequences. The HINT (Hydropathic INTeractions) program was utilized to describe binding, including differences in the functional group contributions as well as sequence selectivity. Of these 65 compounds, two compounds were calculated to have a selectivity (the calculated DeltaDeltaG(sel) between the sequence with the strongest binding and the second strongest binding sequence) greater than -0.75 kcal mol(-1) for one sequence over all others, 10 compounds were specific between -0.50 and -0.74 kcal mol(-1), 18 compounds were specific between -0.25 and -0.49 kcal mol(-1), and 35 compounds were virtually nonspecific with a DeltaDeltaG below -0.24 kcal mol(-1). Several compounds have been identified from this study that include features which may enhance sequence selectivity, including several with a halogen in lieu of the 4'-OH in the daunosamine sugar, one compound with a nonaromatic six-membered ring (pirarubicin) in place of the 4'OH, and a compound with an aromatic ring in the vicinity of the C-14 region (zorubicin). Removal of the methoxy group at the C-4 position on the aglycone portion also appears to add potency and selectivity (idarubicin). Overall, efficient computational methods are presented that can be utilized to analyze the free energy of binding and sequence selectivity of both known and designed analogues of doxorubicin to identify future lead compounds for further experimental research.",

In the present study, a particular emphasis is on the separable nature of the components of the energy and the particular impact of the polarization energy component on deltaE(conf). We perform comparisons with respect to single-point HF, DFT, LMP2, and MP2 computations done at the SIBFA-derived energy minima. Such comparisons are made first for the 10 conformers derived from phi/psi torsional angle energy-minimization (the rigid rotor approach), and, in a second step, after allowing additional relaxation of the C-alpha centered valence angles. In both series of energy-minimization, the SIBFA deltaE(conf) compared best with the LMP2 results using the 6-311G** basis set, the rms being 1.3 kcal/mol. In the absence of the polarization component, the rms is 3.5 kcal/mol. In both series of minimizations, the magnitudes of deltaE(conf), computed as differences with respect to the most stable conformer taken as energy zero, decrease along the series: HF > DFT > LMP2 > SIBFA > MP2, indicative of increasing stabilization of the most highly folded conformers.",

	abstract = "The Polymer Reference Interaction Site Model (PRISM) theory is employed to investigate structure, effective forces, and thermodynamics in dense polymer-particle mixtures in the one and two particle limit. The inﬂuence of particle size, degree of polymerization, and polymer reduced density is established. In the athermal limit, the surface excess is negative implying an entropic dewetting interface. Polymer induced depletion interactions are quantiﬁed via the particle-particle pair correlation function and potential of mean force. A transition from nearly monotonic decaying, attractive depletion interactions to much stronger repulsive-attractive oscillatory depletion forces occurs at roughly the semidilute-concentrated solution boundary. Under melt conditions, the depletion force is extremely large and attractive at contact, but is proceeded by a high repulsive barrier. For particle diameters larger than roughly ﬁve monomer diameters, division of the force by the particle radius results in a nearly universal collapse of the depletion force for all interparticle separations. Molecular dynamics simulations have been employed to determine the depletion force for nanoparticles of a diameter ﬁve times the monomer size over a wide range of polymer densities spanning the semidilute, concentrated, and melt regimes. PRISM calculations based on the spatially nonlocal hypernetted chain closure for particle-particle direct correlations capture all the rich features found in the simulations, with quantitative errors for the amplitude of the depletion forces at the level of a factor of 2 or less. The consequences of monomer-particle attractions are brieﬂy explored. Modiﬁcation of the polymer-particle pair correlations is relatively small, but much larger effects are found for the surface excess including an energetic driven transition to a wetting polymer-particle interface. The particle-particle potential of mean force exhibits multiple qualitatively different behaviors contact aggregation, steric stabilization, local bridging attraction depending on the strength and spatial range of the polymer-particle attraction.",

Through comparison of CCSD(TQ) and CCSD(T) binding energies the first direct assessment of the effects of quadruple excitations on π‚‚‚π interactions is presented. The influence of triple excitations is assessed not only in the conventional manner that permeates the literature (comparison of CCSD(T) and MP2 interaction energies) but also via comparison of CCSD(T) and CCSD data. In systems exhibiting significant electron delocalization, it is well-known that triples contributions to binding energy are quite large (on the order of 1 kcal mol-1). In these cases, quadruple excitations are nonnegligible and tend to be an order of magnitude smaller than the correction to the binding energy from triple excitations (on the order of 0.1 kcal mol-1).

Through micromechanics simulations, we evaluate the properties of these systems in the undamaged, damaged, and healed states and determine optimal conditions for harnessing nanoparticles to act as responsive, self-assembled ‘‘band aids’’ for composite materials.

Other than the parameter L, which keeps track of the rank of the electrostatic interaction, the current {QCT} potential contains only two adjustable parameters of the {Lennard-Jones} type. A system of 216 water molecules was simulated including long-range interactions represented by a high-rank multipolar Ewald summation. High-order multipolar interactions {(L} = 5) are essential to recover the typical features of a liquid-like structure. Liquid simulations at five different temperatures showed a maximum in the density and a temperature profile that agrees fairly well with experiment. The density of simulated water at 300 K and 1 atm is about 0.1\% off the experimental value, while the calculated potential energy of the liquid is within 3\% of the experimental result.

In turn, this involves the partitioning of the extended molecular charge distribution, so that charges and multipole moments can be assigned to different atoms. As an alternate to current approaches, we have investigated a charge partitioning scheme that is based on the maximally localized Wannier functions. This has the advantage of partitioning the charge, and placing it around the molecule in a chemically meaningful manner. Moreover, higher order multipoles may all be calculated without any undue numerical difﬁculties. Tests on isolated molecules and water dimers, show that the molecular electrostatic potentials generated by such a Wannier-function based approach are in excellent agreement with the density functional-based calculations.",

Significant TS stabilization by approximately -23 kcal/mol [MP2/6-31G(d)] relative to the bound substrate is in agreement with that of previous QM/MM modeling and contrasts with suggestions that catalysis by this enzyme arises purely from conformational selection effects. The most important contributions to DTSS come from the residues, Arg90, Arg7, Glu78, a crystallographic water molecule, Arg116, and Arg63, and are dominated by electrostatic effects. Analysis of the differential electrostatic potential of the TS and substrate allows calculation of the catalytic field, predicting the optimal location of charged groups to achieve maximal DTSS. Comparison with the active site of the enzyme from those of several species shows that the positions of charged active site residues correspond closely to the optimal catalytic field, showing that the enzyme has evolved specifically to stabilize the TS relative to the substrate.",

	abstract = "Daunomycin is one of the most important agents used in anticancer chemotherapy. It interacts with {DNA} through intercalation of its planar chromophore between successive base pairs. The effect of intercalation on structure, dynamics and energetics is the topic of a wealth of scientific studies. In the present study, we report a computational examination of the energetics of the intercalation process. In detail, we concentrate on the energetic penalty that intercalation of daunomycin introduces into {DNA} by disturbing it from its unbound conformation. For these means, we are analyzing already published molecular dynamics simulations of {daunomycin-DNA} complexes and present novel simulations of a {bisdaunomycin-DNA} and a {9-dehydroxydaunomycin-DNA} intercalated complex using the {MM-GBSA} module implemented in the {AMBER} suite of programs. Using this molecular dynamics based, continuum solvent method we were able to calculate the energy required to form an intercalation site. Consequently, we compare the free energy of the duplex {d(CGCGCGATCGCGCG)2} in the B-form conformation with the respective conformations when intercalated with daunomycin and a bisintercalating analog. Our results show that the introduction of one single intercalation site costs [{\textasciitilde}]32 kcal/mol. For double intercalation, or intercalation of the bisintercalator, the respective value for one intercalation site decreases to 27 and 24 kcal/mol, respectively, at a theoretical salt concentration of 0.15 M. This proposes that at least in these cases, a synergistic effect takes place. Although it is well known that intercalation leads to substantial disturbance of the {DNA} conformation, already performed investigations suggest a lower energetic penalty. Nevertheless to the best of our knowledge the calculations presented here are the most complete ones and consider hydration effects for the first time. The interaction energy between the ligand and the {DNA} certainly over-compensates this penalty for introducing the intercalation site and thus favors complexation. Such analyses are helpful for the description of allosteric effects in protein ligand binding.",

The estimated interaction energies of the set of geometries explored in this work show that two structures emerge as being the lowest energy, and may effectively be considered as isoenergetic on the basis of the errors inherent in out extrapolation procedure. These structures are the slipped-parallel (C-i) structure (-5.73 kcal/mol) and the cross (D-2d) structure (-5.28 kcal/mol). The T-shaped (C-2v) and sandwich (D-2h) dimers are substantially less stable (-4.34 and -3.78 kcal/mol, respectively). The dispersion interaction is found to be the major source of attraction in the naphthalene dimer. The electrostatic interaction is substantially smaller than the dispersion interaction.

In particular, we focus on surfaces that contain a nanoscopic notch and use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to determine the particle and polymer distribution on the damaged surface. The calculations reveal that a high volume fraction of relatively large particles are localized in the notch. Here, the polymer melt induces a depletion attraction between the particles and surface and thereby drives the nanoparticles into the defect. The time required for these relatively large particles to migrate to the notch is comparable to the time needed for the chains to move by approximately four radius of gyrations. The morphology obtained from the MD simulation serves as the input to the lattice spring model (LSM), which allows us to determine the mechanical properties of the nanocomposite-coated surface. The results show that the stress concentration at the notch tip is significantly reduced due to the presence of the nanoparticles. The application of such nanocomposite coatings could potentially yield defect-free surfaces that exhibit enhanced mechanical properties.",

The movement of both monovalent ions remains diffusive in the presence of {DNA.} Ions sample the complete space available during the simulation time, although individual ions sample only about one-third of the simulation box. Ions preferentially sample electronegative sites around {DNA,} but direct binding to {DNA} bases remains a rather rare event, with highest site occupancy values of {\textless}13\%. The location of direct binding sites depends greatly on the nature of the counterion. While Na+ binding in both grooves is strongly sequence-dependent with the preferred binding site in the minor groove, K+ mainly visits the major groove and binds close to the centre of the oligomer. The electrostatic potential of an average {DNA} structure therefore cannot account for the ability of a site to bind a given cation; other factors must also play a role. An extensive analysis of the influence of counterions on {DNA} conformation showed no evidence of minor groove narrowing upon ion binding. A significant difference between the conformations of the double helix in the different simulations can be attributed to extensive {alpha}/{gamma} transitions in the phosphate backbone during the simulation with Na+. These transitions, with lifetimes over tens of nanoseconds, however, appear to be correlated with ion binding to phosphates. The ion-specific conformational properties of {DNA,} hitherto largely overlooked, may play an important role in {DNA} recognition and binding.",

	abstract = "Accurate and fast evaluation of electrostatic interactions in molecular systems is still one of the most challenging tasks in the rapidly advancing field of macromolecular chemistry, including molecular recognition, protein modeling and drug design. One of the most convenient and accurate approaches is based on a Buckingham-type approximation that uses the multipole moment expansion of molecular/atomic charge distributions. In the mid-1980s it was shown that the pseudoatom model commonly used in experimental X-ray charge density studies can be easily combined with the Buckingham-type approach for calculation of electrostatic interactions, plus atom-atom potentials for evaluation of the total interaction energies in molecular systems. While many such studies have been reported, little attention has been paid to the accuracy of evaluation of the purely electrostatic interactions as errors may be absorbed in the semiempirical atom-atom potentials that have to be used to account for exchange repulsion and dispersion forces. This study is aimed at the evaluation of the accuracy of the calculation of electrostatic interaction energies with the Buckingham approach. To eliminate experimental uncertainties, the atomic moments are based on theoretical single-molecule electron densities calculated at various levels of theory. The electrostatic interaction energies for a total of I I dimers of a-glycine, N-acetylglycine and L-(+)-lactic acid structures calculated according to Buckingham with pseudoatom, stockholder and atoms-in-molecules moments are compared with those evaluated with the Morokuma-Ziegler energy decomposition scheme. For a-glycine a comparison with direct “pixel-by-pixel” integration method, recently developed Gavezzotti, is also made. It is found that the theoretical pseudoatom moments combined with the Buckingham model do predict the correct relative electrostatic interactions energies, although the absolute interaction energies are underestimated in some cases. The good agreement between electrostatic interaction energies computed with Morokuma-Ziegler partitioning, Gavezzotti's method, and the Buckingham approach with atoms-in-molecules moments demonstrates that reliable and accurate evaluation of electrostatic interactions in molecular systems of considerable complexity is now feasible.",

It is the Ehrenfest force that determines the adhesive properties of surfaces.

On the basis of the assembled structures produced and determination of the location and nature of the order-disorder transitions in the system, we propose phase diagrams to describe the behavior of these molecules.

Similar features in the absorption and satellite hole spectra of thionin in the presence of calf thymus {(CT)} {DNA} and polynucleotides {[d(GC)6]2} {(GC)} suggested that thionin preferentially binds to {GC} rather than polynucleotides {[d(AT)6]2} {(AT).} Different binding effects of the two tautomers to {DNA} could be observed. While the imino form fully intercalates into the {DNA} base pairs, the amino form is only partially intercalated. In addition, a broad hole associated with an antihole appeared in the presence of {DNA,} particularly in {GC} base pairs. The coincidence of the antihole with the absorption band of the amino form showed that the amino form is the photoproduct of the imino form. An increase in intensity of the broad hole and its antihole and the loss of nonresonant hole intensity upon interaction with {CT} {DNA} could be described by rapid ground state recovery resulting from fast charge transfer between the intercalated thionin and a guanine base quenching the internal conversion. © 2005 Pleiades Publishing, Inc. {[ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR]}",

For a given nanotube type, what is the maximal loading (H2 coverage)? 3. What is the diameter range and chirality for which H2 adsorption is most energetically favorable? Our simulation results suggest strong dependence of H2 adsorption energies on the nanotube diameter but less dependence on the chirality. Substantial lattice expansion upon H2 adsorption was found. The average adsorption energy increases with the lowering of nanotube diameter (higher curvature) and decreases with higher H2 loading. The calculated H2 vibrational power spectra and radial distribution functions indicate a strong attractive interaction between H2 and nanotube walls. The calculated diffusion coefficients are much higher than what has been reported for H2 in microporous materials such as zeolites, indicating that diffusivity does not present a problem for hydrogen storage in carbon nanotubes.",

Stabilization energies were determined as the sum of the complete basis set (CBS) limit of MP2 stabilization energies and the ∆ECCSD(T) - ∆EMP2 correction term evaluated with the 6-31G*(0.25) basis set. The CBS limit was determined by a two-point extrapolation using the aug-cc-pVXZ basis sets for X ) D and T. While the H-bonding energies are comparable to those of base pairs in a crystal and a vacuum, the stacking energies are considerably smaller in a crystal. Despite this, the stacking is still important and accounts for a significant part of the overall stabilization. It contributes equally to the stability of DNA as does H-bonding for AT-rich DNAs, while in the case of GC-rich DNAs it forms about one-third of the total stabilization. Interstrand stacking reaches surprisingly large values, well comparable to the intrastrand ones, and thus contributes significantly to the overall stabilization. The hairpin structure is characterized by significant stacking, and both guanine‚‚‚cytosine pairs possess stacking energies larger than 11.5 kcal/mol. A high portion of stabilization in the studied hairpin comes from stacking (similar to that found for AT-rich DNAs) despite the fact that it contains two GC Watson-Crick pairs having very large H-bonding stabilization.

Two- and three-body approximations based on interfragment distances were developed and the values appropriate for their accurate application carefully determined. The error in recovering the correlation energy was several millihartree for the two-body FMO-CC method and in the submillihartree range for the three-body FMO-CC method.

The ab initio fragment molecular orbital (FMO) method, which we have recently proposed for the calculations of macromolecules such as proteins, was applied at the HF/STO-3G level. The receptor protein was primarily modeled by 50 amino acid residues surrounding the ligand. The number of atoms in these model complexes is about 850, including hydrogen atoms. For the complexes with EST, RAL, OHT, and DES, the binding energies were calculated again with the entire ER LBD consisting of 241 residues or about 4000 atoms. No signiﬁcant difference was found in the calculated binding energies between the model and the real protein complexes. This indicates that the binding between the protein and its ligands is well characterized by the model protein with the 50 residues. The calculated binding energies relative to EST were very well correlated with the experimental RBA (the correlation coefﬁcient r 0.837) for the ligands studied in this work.

In the crystal structure the sodium ions and water molecules of adjacent unit cells form a positively charged “inorganic layer” with the sodium ions clustered together along the ab faces with the organic (negative) part in between. This puzzling crystal packing is due to a strong favorable interaction between the water molecule and the sodium ions and a substantial charge transfer from the carbanions that balances out the destabilizing sodium-sodium ion repulsion. Although the majority of cohesion energy of the crystal structure comes from the electrostatic interactions of ions, the resulting net stabilization also depends heavily on the nonadditive delocalization components, due to a counterbalance between the two-body delocalization and exchange effects.

The accuracy of the density ﬁtting approximation has been tested for the ethyne dimer. It has been found that the errors in the interaction energies due to density ﬁtting are below 10 3 kcal/mol with suitable auxiliary basis sets and thus one or two orders of magnitude smaller than the errors due to the use of a limited atomic orbital basis set. An investigation of three prominent structures of the benzene dimer, namely, the T shaped, parallel displaced, and sandwich geometries, employing basis sets of up to augmented quadruple- quality shows that DF-DFT-SAPT outperforms second-order Møller-Plesset theory MP2 and gives total interaction energies which are close to the best estimates infered from combining the results of MP2 and coupled-cluster theory with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations.",

This simple scaling allows the construction of master curves and the quantification of material specific aspects independent of the filler-to-monomer diameter ratio. For hard-sphere fillers, four general categories of polymer-mediated organization are found: contact aggregation due to depletion attraction, segment level tight particle bridging, steric stabilization due to thermodynamically stable “bound polymer layers”, and “tele-bridging” where distinct adsorbed layers coexist with longer range bridging. The conditions on the strength and spatial range of monomer-particle attractive interactions that define these different modes of organization have been established. Direct interparticle van der Waals attractions favor contact aggregation and thus compete with the rich polymer-mediated behavior. As the direct attractions increase in strength, the globally stable noncontact bridging configuration is gradually destabilized and replaced by contact aggregation as the most favored state of packing. However, bridging states often remain as metastable local minima. Steric stabilization systems are much less affected by direct interfiller attractions due to the thermodynamic stability of distinct bound polymer layers. This suggests design rules for achieving good particle dispersion. In addition, the interesting possibility is raised that sterically stabilized nanofillers may crystallize in a homopolymer matrix at relatively low volume fractions. Our results have implications for nonequilibrium phenomena such as gelation or filler network formation and kinetic stabilization via large repulsive barriers, which are qualitatively discussed.",

The energies were fit very precisely in terms of all the internuclear distances, using standard least-square procedures, however, with a fitting basis that satisfies permutational symmetry with respect to like atoms. The H5O2+ PES is a fit to 48 189 CCSD(T) energies, containing 7962 polynomial coefficients. The PES has a rms fitting error of 34.9 cm(-1) for the entire data set up to 110000 cm(-1). This surface can describe various internal floppy motions, including the H atom exchanges, monomer inversions, and monomer torsions. First- and higher-order saddle points have been located on the surface and compared with available previous theoretical work. In addition, the PES dissociates correctly (and symmetrically) to H2O + H3O+, with D-e = 11923.8 cm(-1). Geometrical and vibrational properties of the monomer fragments are presented. The corresponding global DMS fit (MP2 based) involves 3844 polynomial coefficients and also dissociates correctly. (C) 2005 American Institute of Physics.",

Complexes between various small molecules (HF, H2O, and NH3) and four main binding sites in (neutral and (N1) anionic) cytosine are considered. Two complexes (O2(N1) and N3(N4)) involve neighboring cytosine proton acceptor and donor sites, which leads to cooperative interactions and bidendate hydrogen bonds. The third (less stable) complex (N4) involves a single cytosine donor. The final (O2-N3) complex involves two cytosine proton acceptors, which leads to an anticooperative hydrogen bonding pattern for H2O and NH3. On the neutral surface, the anticooperative O2-N3 complex is less stable than those involving bidentate hydrogen bonds, and the H2O complex cannot be characterized when diffuse functions are included in the (6-31G(d,p)) basis set. On the contrary, the anionic O2-N3 structure is the most stable complex, while the HF and H2O N3(N4) complexes cannot be characterized with diffuse functions. B3LYP and MP2 potential energy surface scans are used to consider the relationship between the water N3(N4) and O2-N3 complexes. These calculations reveal that diffuse functions reduce the conversion barrier between the two complexes on both the neutral and anionic surfaces, where the reduction leads to a (O2-N3) energy plateau on the neutral surface and complete (N3(N4)) complex destabilization on the anionic surface. From these complexes, the effects of hydrogen bonds on the (N1) acidity of cytosine are determined, and it is found that the trends in the effects of hydrogen bonds on the (N1) acidity are similar for all pyrimidines.",

In the second model, the bilayer is stabilised by a surrounding gas of bphantomQ solvent beads, which do not interact with each other.

Previous efforts have concentrated on using such scaffolds to spatially arrange nanoscopic elements as a strategy for tailoring the electrical, magnetic or photonic properties of the material. Recent theoretical arguments have suggested that synergistic interactions between self-organizing particles and a self-assembling matrix material can lead to hierarchically ordered structures. Here we show that mixtures of diblock copolymers and either cadmium selenide- or ferritin-based nanoparticles exhibit cooperative, coupled self-assembly on the nanoscale. In thin ﬁlms, the copolymers assemble into cylindrical domains, which dictate the spatial distribution of the nanoparticles; segregation of the particles to the interfaces mediates interfacial interactions and orients the copolymer domains normal to the surface, even when one of the blocks is strongly attracted to the substrate. Organization of both the polymeric and particulate entities is thus achieved without the use of external ﬁelds, opening a simple and general route for fabrication of nanostructured materials with hierarchical order.",

This phenomenon results from more repulsive electrostatic interactions as is demonstrated in a model system of cytosine stacked offset-parallel with substituted benzenes. Therefore, the H-bonding capacity of the N3 and O2 atoms of cytosine increases linearly with the electrostatic repulsion between the stacked rings. The local hardness, a density functional theory-based reactivity descriptor, appears to be a key index associated with the molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) minima around H-bond accepting atoms, and is inversely proportional to the electrostatic interaction between stacked molecules. Finally, the MEP minima on surfaces around the bases in experimental structures of DNA and RNA–DNA double helices show that their hydrogen bonding capacity increases when taking more neighboring (intra-strand) stacking partners into account.",

Of primary interest is how to tune the shell of the particle by changing both the length and number of tethered polymers in order to achieve higher loading of nanoparticles within an ordered structure without macrophase separation occurring. We ﬁnd that the phase behavior of the system is very sensitive to the size of the particle including its tethered shell. The region of microphase separation is increased upon decreasing the star polymer size, which may be achieved by shortening and/or removing tethered polymer chains.

We find that both the microscopic mechanism of reorientation and the kinetics of the process strongly depend on the initial degree of order in the system. In a highly ordered lamellar system with the lamellae being aligned perpendicular to the electric field vector, only nucleation and growth of domains is possible as a pathway to reorientation and the process proceeds rather slowly. In less ordered samples, grain rotation becomes possible as an alternative pathway, and the process proceeds considerably faster. The interpretation of our finding is strongly corroborated by dynamic self-consistent field simulations.",

The resulting phase diagrams are presented for composites containing nanoparticles of various sizes and interaction strengths and include lamellae, perforated lamellae, cylinders, and disordered phases. Composites containing large nanoparticles also exhibit two-phase coexistence between different copolymer phases or between a copolymer phase and a nanoparticle phase, depending on the nanoparticle interaction strength. We also present concentration profiles perpendicular to the lamellar interface for nanoparticles of different sizes and interaction strengths. Neutral nanoparticles concentrate at the interface between copolymer domains, while interacting nanoparticles concentrate within the favorable domain. The larger nanoparticles are more easily localized but have less impact on the copolymer concentration profiles. The lamellar spacing increases with nanoparticle volume fraction for interacting nanoparticles but decreases with nanoparticle size. The locations of the phase transitions are in qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions, but the concentration profiles are inconsistent with theoretical predictions.

In biological systems, however, aromatic rings are rarely found in isolated pairs; thus, it is important to understand whether aromatic pairs remain a good model of π-π interactions in clusters. In this study, ab initio methods are used to compute the binding energies of several benzene trimers and tetramers, most of them in 1D stacked configurations. The two-body terms change only slightly relative to the dimer, and except for the cyclic trimer, the three-and four-body terms are negligible. This indicates that aromatic clusters do not feature any large nonadditive effects in their binding energies, and polarization effects in benzene clusters do not greatly change the binding that would be anticipated from unperturbed benzene-benzene interactions, at least for the 1D stacked systems considered. Three-body effects are larger for the cyclic trimer, but for all systems considered, the computed binding energies are within 10\% of what would be estimated from benzene dimer energies at the same geometries.",

Enediyne 1 is triggered by NADPH in a strongly exothermic reaction (-88 kcal/mol), which involves a number of intermediate steps. Untriggered 1 has a high barrier for the Bergman cyclization (52 kcal/mol) that is lowered after triggering to 16.7 kcal/mol due to an epoxide opening and the accompanying strain relief. The Bergman reaction of triggered 1 is slightly exothermic by 2.8 kcal/mol. The singlet biradical formed in this reaction is kinetically stable (activation enthalpies of 19.5 and 21.8 kcal/mol for retro-Bergman reactions) and is as reactive as para-benzyne. The activity-relevant docking mode is an edge-on insertion into the minor groove, whereas the intercalation between base pairs, although leading to larger binding energies, excludes a triggering of 1 and the development of its biological activity. Therefore, an insertion-intercalation model is developed, which can explain all known experimental observations made for 1. On the basis of the insertion-intercalation model it is explained why large intercalation energies suppress the biological activity of dynemicin and why double-strand scission can be achieved only in a two-step mechanism that involves two enediyne molecules, explaining thus the high ratio of single-strand to double-strand scission observed for 1.",

Starting from a poorly ordered state, the cylindrical microdomain orientation was biased by the surface field that initially drove the cylindrical microdomains to be oriented parallel to the film surface. With further annealing, the cylinders were disrupted locally and formed ellipsoid-shaped microdomains that, with time, connected into cylindrical microdomains oriented in the field direction. Starting from an ordered state with cylinders parallel to the surface, the applied electric field enhanced fluctuations at the interfaces of the microdomains. The growth of the fluctuations continued until the cylindrical microdomains broke up into spherical microdomains, similar to that seen in the thermoreversible cylinder-to-sphere orderorder transition. With time, the spherical microdomains deformed into ellipsoidal domains that reconnected into cylindrical microdomains oriented at 45o with respect to the applied field direction. Further annealing aligned the tilted cylinders along the applied field direction. This reorientation process was much slower than from the poorly ordered state. The details of the realignment process are supported by computer simulations based on dynamic self-consistent-field theory.",

In the FMO method, a total energy of the molecule is evaluated by summation of fragment energies and interfragment interaction energies (IFIEs). In this paper, we have proposed a cluster analysis using the dissimilarity that is defined as the squared Euclidean distance between IFIEs of two ligands. Although the result of an ordered table by clustering is still a massive collection of numbers, we combine a clustering method with a graphical representation of the IFIEs by representing each data point with colors that quantitatively and qualitatively reflect the IFIEs. We applied VISCANA to a docking study of pharmacophores of the human estrogen receptor alpha ligand-binding domain (57 amino acid residues). By using VISCANA, we could classify even structurally different ligands into functionally similar clusters according to the interaction pattern of a ligand and amino acid residues of the receptor protein. In addition, VISCANA could estimate the correct docking conformation by analyzing patterns of the receptor-ligand interactions of some conformations through the docking calculation.",

The binding constant for the interaction between proflavine and DNA was K = 2.32 (±0.41) × 104 M–1 and the binding site size was 2.07 (±0.1) base pairs, estimated in voltammetric measurements. The value of the binding site size was determined to be closer to that expected for a planar intercalating agent. The standard Gibbs free-energy change is ca. –24.90 kJ/mol at 25˚C, indicating the spontaneity of the binding interaction.

By imposing the correct experimental unit cell environment, an initial configuration with two ideal B-DNA duplexes in the unit cell is shown to converge to the crystallographic structure. This convergence is measured by the appearance of sequence-dependent features that very closely resemble the crystallographic ones as well as by the decay of the all-atom root-mean-squared coordinates deviations (RMSD) with respect to the crystallographic structure. Given the appropriate crystallographic constraints, this is the first example of multiple nanosecond molecular dynamics trajectory that shows an ideal B-DNA model converging to an experimental structure, with a significant decay of RMSD.",

Calculations were performed with the AMBER94 force field and at the HF and MP2 levels with several basis sets. The interfragment interaction energies (IFIEs) were analyzed for interactions of CRP-cAMP with each base pair, DNA duplex with each amino acid residue, and each base pair with each residue. In addition, base-base interactions were analyzed including hydrogen bonding and stacking of DNA. In the interaction between DNA and CRP-cAMP, there was a significant charge transfer (CT) from the DNA to CRP. and this CT interaction played an important role as well as the electrostatic interactions. It is necessary to apply a quantum mechanical approach beyond the “classical” force-field approach to describe the sequence specificity. In the DNA intramolecular interaction, the dispersion interactions dominated the stabilization of the base-pair stacking interactions. Strong, attractive 1,2-stacking interactions and weak, repulsive 1,3-stacking interactions were observed. Comparison of the intramolecular interactions of free and complexed DNA revealed that the base-pairing interactions were stronger, and the stacking interactions were weaker, in the complexed structure. Therefore, the DNA duplex stability appears to change due to both the electrostatic and the CT interactions that take place under conditions of DNA-CRP binding. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

	abstract = "The ab initio fragment molecular orbital calculations were performed for molecular interactions of the whole estrogen receptor (ER) ligand-binding domain with a natural ligand, 17 ss-estradiol (EST). The interaction energies of the ligand at the residue level were calculated using HF and MP2 methods with several basis sets. The charge-transfer (CT) interactions were also analyzed based on configuration analysis for fragment interaction. Strong electrostatic interactions were observed between the EST and surrounding charged/polarized residues, Glu353, Arg394, His524, and Thr347. Weak electrostatic and significant van der Waals dispersion interactions were observed between the EST and the many surrounding hydrophobic residues. Together with the experimental interpretations, both interactions equally contributed to the total binding energies, and it was found that the inclusion of electron correlation was essential to obtain an appropriate picture of the interaction. The strongest interaction energy was observed between Glu353 and the EST, and the CT interactions from the lone- pair orbital of the carbonyl oxygen of Glu353 to the alpha*(OH) orbital of the hydroxyl group of EST were found to be important. The CT interactions from the lone- pair orbital of EST to the alpha*(NH) of Arg394 and from the lone- pair orbital of EST to the alpha*(NH) of His524 were also observed. These CT interactions occurred through the hydrogen-bond networks between the ER and EST. Therefore, electron donations from the ER to the EST and electron back-donations from EST to the ER were characteristic of ER-ligand binding. Our approach provides a powerful tool to understanding detailed molecular interactions at the quantum mechanical level.",

This atom by atom scheme (CPaa) is based on the consideration that the proximity of the fragments may affect the intramolecular BSSE of every involved species, and artificially influences the value of the BSSE associated to the supermolecule formation. It drastically decreases the reported counterpoise overcorrection of the A-B interaction, even though it does not deal with all the overcorrection because it includes all the orbitals, and not only the unoccupied ones.

However, crack formation is a critical problem in these materials; thus, designing layered systems that can respond to environmental changes and undergo self-healing is particularly important for a range of technologies. Here, nanoparticles dispersed in a polymer matrix were found to migrate to a crack generated at the interface between the polymer and a glassy layer. Segregation of the nanoparticles to the crack depended on both the enthalpic and entropic interactions between the polymer and nanoparticles. In particular, poly(ethylene oxide)-covered 5.2-nm spherical nanoparticles in a poly(methyl methacrylate) matrix diffused to cracks in the adjoining silicon oxide layer, whereas tri-n-octylphosphine oxide-covered nanoparticles did not. These results point to a simple means of fabricating systems that can self-heal, improving the durability of multilayered systems, or form the basis for auto-responsive materials.",

For hard fillers, two distinct phase separation behaviors, separated by a miscibility window, are generically predicted. One demixing curve occurs at relatively low monomer-particle attraction strength and corresponds to a very abrupt transition from an entropic depletion attraction-induced phase separated state to an enthalpically stabilized miscible fluid. The homogeneous mixture arises via a steric stabilization mechanism associated with the formation of thin, thermodynamically stable bound polymer layers around fillers. The second demixing transition occurs at relatively high monomer-particle adsorption energy and is inferred to involve the formation of an equilibrium physical network phase with local bridging of particles by polymers. This spinodal is sensitive to both particle-monomer diameter ratio and the spatial range of the interfacial attraction. The miscibility window narrows, and can ultimately disappear, with increasing polymer chain length, direct van der Waals attractions between fillers, and/or particle-monomer size asymmetry ratio. The implications of our results for the design of well-dispersed thermodynamically stable polymer nanocomposites, and the formation of nonequilibrium gels, are discussed.",

The standard Counterpoise correction was applied to approximately eliminate basis set superposition errors. The fit is based on an approach that incorporates the permutational symmetry of identical atoms [Huang, X.: Braams, B.; Bowman, J. M. J. Chem. Phys. 2005, 122, 044308]. The DMS is a fit to the dipole moment obtained with Møller–Plesset (MP2) theory, using an aug-cc-pVTZ basis. The PES has an RMS fitting error of 31 cm(-1) for energies below 20 000 cm-1, relative to the global minimum. This surface can describe various internal floppy motions, including various monomer inversions, and isomerization pathways. Ten characteristic stationary points have been located on the surface, four of which are transition structures and the rest are higher order saddle points. Their geometrical and vibrational properties are presented and compared with available previous theoretical work. The CCSD(T)-PES and MP2-DMS dissociate correctly (and symmetrically) to two H2O monomers, with D-e 1665.7 cm(-1) (19.93 kJ/mol). Accurate quantum calculations of the zero-point energy of the dimer (using diffusion Monte Carlo) and the monomers (using, a vibrational configuration interaction approach) are reported, and these together with D-e give a value of D-0 of 1042 cm(-1) (12.44 kJ/mol).

The stabilization energy of the cationic intercalators is considerably larger than that of the uncharged one. The dominant energy contribution with all intercalators is represented by dispersion energy. In the case of the cationic intercalators, the electrostatic and charge-transfer terms are also important. The DG of ethidium intercalation to DNA was estimated at À4.5 kcal molÀ1 and this value agrees well with the experimental result. Of six contributions to the final free energy, the interaction energy value is crucial. The intercalation process is governed by the non-covalent stacking (including charge-transfer) interaction while the hydrogen bonding between the ethidium amino groups and the DNA backbone is less important. This is confirmed by the evaluation of the interaction energy as well as by the calculation of the free energy change. The intercalation affects the macroscopic properties of DNA in terms of its flexibility.

The distribution of the particle additives within the grain boundary region depends on the level of perturbation of the equilibrium structure and presents analogies to previously described block copolymer/homopolymer blends. At small tilt angles (chevron grain boundary) the particle distribution is equal to the equilibrium distribution (here: center location of PS-coated gold particles within the PS domains of a PS-PEP block copolymer) whereas at larger tilt angles (omega or T-junction grain boundary structure) the particles are found to selectively swell the high elastic energy regions along the grain boundary, thereby stabilizing the formation of otherwise energetically unfavorable grain boundary structures presumably through the relaxation of chains in the grain boundary region. The direct visualization of the swelling process provides the first experimental evidence for the mechanism of stabilization of energetically unfavorable grain boundary structures by selective swelling and stress relief that was previously postulated for block copolymer/homopolymer blends and presents a model system for comparison with theoretical predictions.",

This approach has two important advantages: it is very accurate by avoiding the deﬁciencies of multipole treatments, and it provides a complete electrostatic, polarization, and hyperpolarization description of interaction forces as well as energies. In this paper, we present a more general treatment of the theory and an extended demonstration of the physical accuracy of this approach, and we explore the geometric dependence of the parameters of this treatment (charge density, linearly and non-linearly induced charge density, and their derivatives) for a series of ﬂuoromethane molecules interacting with a two-site FH. We ﬁnd that, for variation in linear separation along the C–H/F–H line, these parameters are very well represented by a arKb dependence, a and b being constants. For a large number of conﬁgurations, the relative rms between the predicted energies and atomic forces and the ab initio calculated values is w3–5\%. This study opens the way to a more complete description of the three-dimensional characterization of these parameters.",

The {MP2} potential energy surfaces of the stacked dimers are considered as a function of four variables (vertical displacement, angle of rotation, horizontal displacement, and tilt angle) using a variety of basis sets. It is found that the maximum stacking interaction energy decreases with the amino acid according to {TRP} {\textgreater} {TYR} {HIS} {\textgreater} {PHE} for both nucleobases. However, the magnitude of the stacking interaction significantly increases upon alkylation (by 50115\%). Comparison of the stacking energies calculated using our surface scans to those estimated from experimental crystal structures indicates that the stacking interactions within the active site of 3-methyladenine {DNA} glycosylase can account for 6575\% of the maximum possible stacking interaction between the relevant molecules. The decrease in stacking in the crystal structure arises due to significant differences in the relative orientations of the nucleobase and amino acid. Nevertheless, alkylation is found to significantly increase the stacking energy when the crystal structure geometries are considered. Our calculations provide computational support for suggestions that alkylation enhances the stacking interactions within the active site of {DNA} repair enzymes, and they give a measure of the magnitude of this enhancement. Our results suggest that alkylation likely plays a more important role in substrate identification and removal than the nature of the aromatic amino acid that interacts with the substrate via stacking interactions.",

Both TEM images and SAXS results show clearly that incorporation of surfactant-tethered CdS QD preferentially into PEO blocks leads to increases in thermal stabilities of both bcc-packed lattice (referred as long-range order) and microdomains themselves in the sphere-forming SE/CdS composites. The bcc-packed lattice in the SE/CdS composites sustains better than that in the neat SE, during a temperature elevation to w160 8C, at which the bcc-packed SE/CdS spheres start to transform into micelles with a short-range liquid-like order. Quantitative model analysis shows that the PEO/CdS micelles can retain their size in the SE/CdS composites up to 200C, whereas the PEO micelles shrink after the softening of the PS matrix around 100 8C, and disassociate largely into the PS matrix of the neat SE at 160C.",

Remarkably, {FAAH} hydrolyzes amides and esters with similar rates; however, the normal preference for esters reemerges when Lys142 is mutated to alanine. To elucidate the hydrolysis mechanisms and the causes behind this variation of selectivity, mixed quantum and molecular mechanics {(QM/MM)} calculations were carried out to obtain free-energy profiles for alternative mechanisms for the enzymatic hydrolyses. The methodology features free-energy perturbation calculations in Monte Carlo simulations with {PDDG/PM3} as the {QM} method. For wild-type {FAAH,} the results support a mechanism, which features proton transfer from Ser217 to Lys142, simultaneous proton transfer from Ser241 to Ser217, and attack of Ser241 on the substrate's carbonyl carbon to yield a tetrahedral intermediate, which subsequently undergoes elimination with simultaneous protonation of the leaving group by a {Lys142-Ser217} proton shuttle. For the {Lys142Ala} mutant, a striking multistep sequence is proposed with simultaneous proton transfer from Ser241 to Ser217, attack of Ser241 on the carbonyl carbon of the substrate, and elimination of the leaving group and its protonation by Ser217. Support comes from the free-energy results, which well reproduce the observation that the {Lys142Ala} mutation in {FAAH} decreases the rate of hydrolysis for oleamide significantly more than for methyl oleate.",

Although many elements of this puzzle were elucidated by biochemical and structural studies, the source of the catalytic power of enzymes has not been widely understood and, clearly, has not been agreed upon by the scientific community. The current consensus is sometimes reduced to statements such as, “the enzyme binds the transition state stronger than the ground state” or “the catalytic groups are perfectly oriented”.

Here, we examined the interactions of the {H2TMPyP4} with three distinct G-quadruplex {DNAs,} the parallel-stranded {(TG4T)4,} dimer-hairpin-folded {(G4T4G4)2,} and monomer-folded {AG3(T2AG3)3,} by ultraviolet resonance Raman spectroscopy {(UVRR),} {UVvis} absorption spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy {(SERS).} The data obtained by the continuous variation titration method show that the binding stoichiometry of {H2TMPyP4/G-quadruplex} is 2:1 for {(TG4T)4} and 4:1 for {(G4T4G4)2} or {AG3(T2AG3)3.} The results of {SERS} spectra, {UVvis} absorption titration, and fluorescence emission spectra together with the binding stoichiometries reveal that two {H2TMPyP4} molecules are externally stacked at two ends of the parallel {(TG4T)4} G-quadruplex, whereas {H2TMPyP4} molecules can intercalate within their diagonal or lateral loop regions and intervals between two G-tetrads for {(G4T4G4)2} and {AG3(T2AG3)3} G-quadruplexes. The binding of {H2TMPyP4} to {(TG4T)4} G-quadruplex results in the hypochromicity of the {UV} Raman signal of {(TG4T)4,} indicating that the stacking effects between {H2TMPyP4} and {DNA} bases are significant. The Raman hyperchromicities and shifts are observed after the binding of {H2TMPyP4} to both {(G4T4G4)2} and {AG3(T2AG3)3} G-quadruplexes. This indicates that the intercalative {H2TMPyP4} can lengthen the vertical distance between adjacent G-tetrads of {(G4T4G4)2} and {AG3(T2AG3)3} and change their conformations.

A cornerstone of such understanding is provided by statistical mechanics, which bridges the gap between molecular events and the structural and physiochemical properties of macro- and mesoscopic systems. With ever-increasing computer power, molecular simulations and ab initio quantum mechanics are promising to provide a nearly exact route to accomplishing the full potential of statistical mechanics. However, in light of their versatility for solving problems involving multiple length and timescales that are yet unreachable by direct simulations, phenomenological and semiempirical methods remain relevant for chemical engineering applications in the foreseeable future. Classical density functional theory offers a compromise: on the one hand, it is able to retain the theoretical rigor of statistical mechanics and, on the other hand, similar to a phenomenological method, it demands only modest computational cost for modeling the properties of uniform and inhomogeneous systems. Recent advances are summarized of classical density functional theory with emphasis on applications to quantitative modeling of the phase and interfacial behavior of condensed ﬂuids and soft materials, including colloids, polymer solutions, nanocomposites, liquid crystals, and biological systems. Attention is also given to some potential applications of density functional theory to material fabrications and biomolecular engineering.",

The structure of this 22 nt sequence in the presence of K+ has drawn intense interest as the intracellular K+ concentration is greater than that of Na+. However, the question of the type of structure for the 22 nt telomeric sequence in K+ solution remains open. In this study, we substituted the Gs in the sequence with 8-bromoguanine and examined the resultant structures and thermal stabilities by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The results suggest that the 22 nt in K+ solution exists as a mixture of mixed-parallel/antiparallet and chair-type G-quadruplex. To date, the exact structure of human telomeric G-quadruplex in K+ solution is extremely controversial.

Using the series of correlation-consistent polarized valence basis sets, cc-pVXZ, the basis set truncation error is expressed as EX X + i − . The angular momentum offset i captures differences in effective rates of convergence previously observed for ﬁrst-row molecules. It is based on simple electron counts and tends to values close to 0 for hydrogen-rich compounds and values closer to 1 for pure ﬁrst-row compounds containing several electronegative atoms. The formula is motivated theoretically by the structure of correlation-consistent basis sets which include basis functions up to angular momentum L = X − 1 for hydrogen and helium and up to L = X for ﬁrst-row atoms. It contains three parameters which are calibrated against a large set of 105 reference molecules H, C, N, O, F for extrapolations of MP2 and CCSD valence-shell correlation energies from double- and triple-zeta DT and triple- and quadruple-zeta TQ basis sets. The new model is shown to be three to ﬁve times more accurate than previous two-point schemes using a single parameter, and TQ extrapolations are found to reproduce a small set of available R12 reference data better than even 56 extrapolations using the conventional asymptotic limit formula EX X−3.

	abstract = "The electron correlation energy of two-electron atoms is known to converge asymptotically as L + 1 −3 to the complete basis set limit, where L is the maximum angular momentum quantum number included in the basis set. Numerical evidence has established a similar asymptotic convergence X−3 with the cardinal number X of correlation-consistent basis sets cc-pVXZ for coupled cluster singles and doubles CCSD and second order perturbation theory MP2 calculations of molecules. The main focus of this article is to probe for deviations from asymptotic convergence behavior for practical values of X by deﬁning a trial function X− that for an effective exponent = eff X , X + 1 , X + N provides the correct energy EX+N, when extrapolating from results for two smaller basis sets, EX and EX+1. This analysis is ﬁrst applied to “model” expansions available from analytical theory, and then to a large body of ﬁnite basis set results X = D , T , Q , 5 , 6 for 105 molecules containing H, C, N, O, and F, complemented by a smaller set of 14 molecules for which accurate complete basis set limits are available from MP2-R12 and CCSD-R12 calculations. eff is generally found to vary monotonically with the target of extrapolation, X + N, making results for large but ﬁnite basis sets a useful addition to the limited number of cases where complete basis set limits are available. Signiﬁcant differences in effective convergence behavior are observed between MP2 and CCSD valence correlation energies, between hydrogen-rich and hydrogen-free molecules, and, for He, between partial-wave expansions and correlation-consistent basis sets. Deviations from asymptotic convergence behavior tend to get smaller as X increases, but not always monotonically, and are still quite noticeable even for X = 5. Finally, correlation contributions to atomization energies rather than total energies exhibit a much larger variation of effective convergence behavior, and extrapolations from small basis sets are found to be particularly erratic for molecules containing several electronegative atoms. Observed effects are discussed in the light of results known from analytical theory. A carefully calibrated protocol for extrapolations to the complete basis set limit is presented, based on a single “optimal” exponent opt X , X + 1 , for the entire set of molecules, and compared to similar approaches reported in the literature.",

The preparation of polymer-particle hybrid materials requires a good understanding of the chemical nature and topology of the amphiphilic molecules as well as their interactions with the embedded nanoparticles. This article reports a density functional theory (DFT) for a coarse-grained model of block copolymer-nanoparticle mixtures that is able to account for the properties of particles and copolymers within a self-consistent framework. It predicts various well-organized structures that can be effectively controlled by adjusting the polymer chain length and polymer-particle interactions. Illustrative examples based on relatively short chains suggest that, in qualitative agreement with experiments, large particles tend to be excluded from a polymer brush near a solid substrate, whereas smaller particles may be dissolved. The DFT is able to capture the dispersion of large particles in the microdomain of block copolymer that is energetically favorable, but localization of smaller particles at the microdomain interfaces.",

In this FMO2-TDDFT scheme, the system is divided into fragments, and the electron density for fragments is determined self-consistently. Consequently, only one main fragment of interest and several fragment pairs including it are calculated by TDDFT. To demonstrate the accuracy of FMO2-TDDFT, we computed several low-lying singlet and triplet excited states of solvated phenol and polyalanine using our method and the standard TDDFT for the full system. The BLYP functional with the long-range correction LC-BLYP was employed with the 6-31G* basis set some tests were also performed with 6-311G*, as well as with B3LYP and time-dependent Hartree-Fock . Typically, FMO2-TDDFT reproduced the full TDDFT excitation energies within 0.1 eV, and for one excited state the error was about 0.2 eV. Beside the accurate reproduction of the TDDFT excitation energies, we also automatically get an excitation energy decomposition analysis, which provides the contributions of individual fragments. Finally, the efﬁciency of our approach was exempliﬁed on the LC-BLYP/ 6-31G* calculation of the lowest singlet excitation of the photoactive yellow protein which consists of 1931 atoms, and the obtained value of 3.1 eV is in agreement with the experimental value of 2.8 eV.",

We have carried out a natural bond order B3LYP analysis of the molecules CF3X, with X = F, Cl, Br and I. It shows that the Cl, Br and I atoms in these molecules closely approximate the s(2)p(x)(2)p(y)(2)p(z)(1) configuration, where the z-axis is along the R-X bond. The three unshared pairs of electrons produce a belt of negative electrostatic potential around the central part of X, leaving the outermost region positive, the sigma-hole. This is not found in the case of fluorine, for which the combination of its high electronegativity plus significant sp-hybridization causes an influx of electronic charge that neutralizes the sigma-hole. These factors become progressively less important in proceeding to Cl, Br and I, and their effects are also counteracted by the presence of electron-withdrawing substituents in the remainder of the molecule. Thus a sigma-hole is observed for the Cl in CF3Cl, but not in CH3Cl.",

The major trends in the interaction energy can be rationalised using a simple model based on electrostatic interactions between the pi-faces of the two aromatic rings. However, electrostatic interactions between the substituents of one ring and the pi-face of the other make an additional contribution, due to the slight offset in the stacking geometry.

The three {TTA} loop segments adopt different conformations, with the first {TTA} assuming a double-chain-reversal loop conformation, and the second and third {TTA} assuming lateral loop conformations. The {NMR} structure is very well defined, including the three {TTA} loops and the two flanking sequences at 5'- and 3'-ends. Our study indicates that the three loop regions interact with the core G-tetrads in a specific way that defines and stabilizes the unique human telomeric G-quadruplex structure in K+. Significantly, a novel adenine triple platform is formed with three naturally occurring adenine residues, A21, A3 and A9, capping the top tetrad of the hybrid-type telomeric G-quadruplex.

As NP concentration increases, the conversion of perpendicular to parallel lamellar morphology at the free surface slows down.

Because it creates capillary pressure on a NP, this “universal” wetting layer is proposed to be responsible for NP embedding. The value of h* is independent of the molecular weight of PS and constant during the embedding process. The value of h* is found to be similar to the equilibrium wetting layer thickness of a polymer melt spreading on a metal substrate. Using a model that includes the spreading coefficient, long-range van der Waals interactions, and a chain-stretching penalty, h* is shown to be independent of the molecular weight of the polymer.

Here, we propose a mesoscale thermodynamic model describing the transitions in membrane morphology observed after exposure to various types of nanoparticles. Our simulations demonstrate under which conditions (determined by particle size and hydrophilic/hydrophobic interactions) the particles can adsorb into the membrane or compromise the membrane integrity to result in the formation of nanosized holes.

In addition to its physiological role in healthy organisms, angiogenesis is extremely important in cancer growth and metastasis, resulting in numerous attempts to understand its control and to develop new approaches to anticancer therapy. The alpha-aminoalkylphosphonate diphenyl esters are well known as highly efficient serine protease inhibitors. However, their mode of binding has not been verified experimentally in details. For a group of average and potent phosphonic inhibitors of urokinase, flexible docking calculations were performed to gain an insight into the active site interactions responsible for observed enzyme inhibition. The docking results are consistent with the previously suggested mode of inhibitors binding. Subsequently, rigorous ab initio study of binding energy was carried out, followed by its decomposition according to the variation-perturbation procedure to reveal stabilization energy constituents with clear physical meaning. Availability of the experimental inhibitory activities and comparison with theoretical binding energy allows for the validation of theoretical models of inhibition, as well as estimation of the possible potential for binding affinity prediction. Since the docking results accompanied by molecular mechanics optimization suggested that several crucial active site contacts were too short, the optimal distances corresponding to the minimum ab initio interaction energy were also evaluated. Despite the deficiencies of force field-optimized enzyme-inhibitor structures, satisfactory agreement with experimental inhibitory activity was obtained for the electrostatic interaction energy, suggesting its possible application in the binding affinity prediction.}",

	Pages = "53–71",
	abstract = "The binding of small molecules to double stranded DNA including intercalation between base pairs has been a topic of research for over 40 years. For the most part, however, intercalation has been of marginal interest given the prevailing notion that binding of small molecules to protein receptors is largely responsible for governing biological function. This picture is now changing with the discovery of nuclear enzymes, e.g. topoisomerases that modulate intercalation of various compounds including certain antitumor drugs and genotoxins. While intercalators are classically ﬂat, aromatic structures that can easily insert between base pairs, our laboratories reported in 1977 that a number of biologically active compounds with greater molecular thickness, e.g. steroid hormones, could ﬁt stereospeciﬁcally between base pairs. The hypothesis was advanced that intercalation was a salient feature of the action of gene regulatory molecules. Two parallel lines of research were pursued: (1) development of technology to employ intercalation in the design of safe and effective chemicals, e.g. pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, agricultural chemicals; (2) exploration of intercalation in the mode of action of nuclear receptor proteins. Computer modeling demonstrated that degree of ﬁt of certain small molecules into DNA intercalation sites correlated with degree of biological activity but not with strength of receptor binding. These ﬁndings led to computational tools including pharmacophores and search engines to design new drug candidates by predicting desirable and undesirable activities. The speciﬁc sequences in DNA into which ligands best intercalated were later found in the consensus sequences of genes activated by nuclear receptors implying intercalation was central to their mode of action. Recently, the orientation of ligands bound to nuclear receptors was found to match closely the spatial locations of ligands derived from intercalation into unwound gene sequences suggesting that nuclear receptors may be guiding ligands to DNA with remarkable precision. Based upon multiple lines of experimental evidence, we suggest that intercalation in double stranded DNA is a ubiquitous, natural process and a salient feature of the regulation of genes. If double stranded DNA is proven to be the ultimate target of genomic drug action, intercalation will emerge as a cornerstone of the future discovery of safe and effective pharmaceuticals.",

All bonding, as signified by the presence of a bond path, has a common origin in terms of the mechanics determined by the Ehrenfest, Feynman and virial theorems.

Increasing filler volume fraction has a profound effect on the polymer matrix, inducing oscillatory reorganization on a length scale commensurate with the nanoparticle diameter. The near contact interfacial monomer-filler pair correlations are suppressed by nanoparticle addition, but on larger scales power law correlations emerge with filler imprinted oscillatory features. Increased nanoparticle volume fraction also substantially changes interfiller packing, inducing a transition from a highly bridged or sterically stabilized type of organization in the infinite dilution limit to more diffuse liquidlike packing characterized by many-particle clustering. Distinctive modifications of the collective polymer structure factor include an increase in the osmotic compressibility, the emergence of a large bound layer or microphase-separation-like scattering peak on a length scale controlled by filler size indicative of distinct bound polymer layers, and a local rarefaction and suppression of the coherence of the monomer cage scale packing. All the real and Fourier space correlations depend in distinctive manners on the physical and chemical variables (filler size, volume fraction, strength and spatial range of the interfacial cohesion) and proximity to the contact aggregation and bridging phase separation boundaries. The bulk modulus of the nanocomposite generically softens with the addition of fillers corresponding to enhanced total density fluctuations.",

These dimers have properties similar to larger delocalized pi...pi systems such as benzene dimer but are small enough that they can be probed in far greater detail with high accuracy electronic structure methods. Parallel-slipped and T-shaped structures of both cyanogen dimer and diacetylene dimer have been optimized with 15 different procedures. The effects of basis set size, theoretical method, counterpoise correction, and the rigid monomer approximation on the structure and energetics of each dimer have been examined. MP2 and CCSD( T) optimized geometries for all four dimer structures are reported, as well as estimates of the CCSD( T) complete basis set (CBS) interaction energy for every optimized geometry. The data reported here suggest that future optimizations of delocalized pi...pi clusters should be carried out with basis sets of triple-zeta quality. Larger basis sets and the expensive counterpoise correction to the molecular geometry are not necessary. The rigid monomer approximation has very little effect on structure and energetics of these dimers and may be used without consequence. Due to a consistent cancellation of errors, optimization with the MP2 method leads to CCSD(T)/CBS interaction energies that are within 0.2 kcal mol(-1) of those for structures optimized with the CCSD( T) method. Future studies that aim to resolve structures separated by a few tenths of a kcal mol(-1) should consider the effects of optimization with the CCSD(T) method.",

	abstract = "A new parallel implementation of the Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles (CCSD) and related wave functions (e.g Quadratic Configuration Interaction, QCI, and Coupled Electron Pair, CEPA) is described, based on the Array Files middleware. The program can handle large basis sets, even without utilizing symmetry, on modest distributed memory workstation clusters. High computational efficiency is achieved by formulating all major operations in terms of matrix multiplications. Timings are provided for systems with 50-228 valence electrons and up to 1144 basis functions, with little or no symmetry. Our largest calculation (QCISD/aug-cc-pVQZ for the parallel displaced benzene dimer) uses 1512 basis functions. Calculations on the benzene dimer show that the usual procedure of estimating the effect of basis set enlargement from second-order Møller-Plesset (MP2) calculations is less reliable than previously assumed. Replacing the weak pair amplitudes in CCSD/QCISD calculations by MP2 amplitudes affects the calculated energy only slightly.",

This method is conceptually similar to existing {EDA} methods such as Morokuma analysis but includes several important new features. The first is a fully self-consistent treatment of the energy lowering due to polarization, which is evaluated by a self-consistent field calculation in which the molecular orbital coefficients are constrained to be block-diagonal (absolutely localized) in the interacting molecules to prohibit charge transfer. The second new feature is the ability to separate forward and back-donation in the charge-transfer energy term using a perturbative approximation starting from the optimized block-diagonal reference. The newly proposed {EDA} method is used to understand the fundamental aspects of intermolecular interactions such as the degree of covalency in the hydrogen bonding in water and the contributions of forward and back-donation in synergic bonding in metal complexes. Additionally, it is demonstrated that this method can be used to identify the factors controlling the interaction of the molecular hydrogen with open metal centers in potential hydrogen storage materials and the interaction of methane with rhenium complexes.",

But it can also depend on the kinetics of self-assembly in the polymer, and there are circumstances under which the kinetics of morphologically selective domain nucleation and growth determine the overall nanostructure of the composite. To study the mechanism of morphological seeding in block-copolymer nanocomposites, we have combined cylinder phases of polystyrene-block-polyisoprene diblock (as a solution in dibutylphthalate) and poly(styrene-block-isoprene-block-styrene) triblock (as a blend with homopolystyrene) copolymers with gold nanorods of different diameters and surface treatments. Polarized optical microscopy and transmission electron microscopy on these composites demonstrate that the nanorods selectively nucleate coaxial domains of copolymer cylinders (i.e., domains of cylinders aligned along the same axis as the nanorod). These single nucleation events occur regardless of nanorod diameter and surface character, and determine the order of most of the surrounding polymer. Mesoscale modeling of the nucleation process, performed with nanorods of different diameters and with different polymeresurface interactions, illustrates the mechanism by which copolymer-dispersed nanorods with different sizes and surface chemistry can template the organization of cylindrical copolymer domains.",

In the so-called wet brush limit, when the graft molecualr weight equals or exceeds the matrix value, the silica particles form a uniform random dispersion in poly(styrene). Increasing the hompolymer matrix molecular weight above the graft value results in particle clustering and macroscopic-phase separation. Mixtures of the lamellar formaing block copolymer and nanoparticles exhibit a very different trend, with particle clustering at the lower PS-PB molecular weights and dispersion at the highest value. This latter finding is rationalized on the basis of packing constraints associated with lamnellar order and the effective particle dimensions, and the degree of solvation at ordering, both of which favor higher molecualr weight block copolymers.",

	abstract = "An understanding of the mechanism by which minor groove binding agents interact with DNA has led to the design of agents that can reversibly bind with high selectivity to extended DNA target sequences. Simple compounds, such as the polypyrroles and the bis-benzimidazoles, have been used as carriers for alkylating agents effectively directing alkylation to speciﬁc DNA sequences. The spectrum of DNA alkylation and mutation by classical alkylators, such as nitrogen mustards, has been profoundly modiﬁed by such attachment. The observed “side-by-side” binding of small polypyrrole antibiotics has led to the design of synthetic hairpin polyamides with programmable DNA sequence selectivity. These compounds are able to compete with natural substrates, such as speciﬁc transcription factors, and alter gene expression. They are being developed as artiﬁcial transcription factors, able to deliver activating peptides to speciﬁc recognition sequences, and as potential protein–DNA dimerization agents. Hairpin polyamides are also being used as carriers for the delivery of alkylators to deﬁned DNA sites. The degree of control of gene expression thus offered by the hairpin polyamides suggests enormous promise for their clinical utility. Recent developments with other minor groove binding small molecules and technological advances are also discussed.",

Nevertheless, the presence of signature G-rich motifs in the eukaryotic genome, and the plethora of proteins that bind to, modify or resolve this nucleic acid structure in vitro have provided circumstantial evidence for its physiological relevance. More recently, direct visualisation of G-quadruplex DNA at native telomeres was achieved, bolstering the evidence for its existence in the cell. Furthermore, G-quadruplex folded telomeric DNA has been found to perturb telomere function and to impede the action of telomerase, an enzyme overexpressed in > 85\% of human cancers, hence opening up a novel avenue for cancer therapy in the form of G-quadruplex stabilising agents.",

The {DNA} quadruplex topology is parallel-stranded with external double-chain-reversal propeller loops, consistent with previous structural determinations. The porphyrin molecules bind by stacking onto the {TTA} nucleotides, either as part of the external loop structure or at the 5` region of the stacked quadruplex. This involves stacked on hydrogen-bonded base pairs, formed from those nucleotides not involved in the formation of G-tetrads, and there are thus no direct ligand interactions with G-tetrads. This is in accord with the relative nonselectivity by {TMPyP4} for quadruplex {DNAs} compared to duplex {DNA.} Porphyrin binding is achieved by remodeling of loops compared to the ligand-free structures.

Although the calculations support suggestions from experiments that hypoxanthine preferentially binds with cytosine, the trend in the calculated hydrogen-bond strengths for the remaining natural nucleobases do not show a strong correlation with the experimentally predicted binding preferences. However, our calculations suggest that the stacking interactions of hypoxanthine are similar in magnitude to the hydrogen-bonding interactions at all levels of theory (with the exception of B3LYP, which incorrectly predicts stacked dimers to be unstable). Therefore, stacking interactions should also be considered when analyzing the stability of DNA helices containing hypoxanthine and the use of larger models that account for both hydrogen-bonding and stacking within DNA duplexes will likely result in better agreement with experimental observations. For the majority of the dimers, PWB6K and AMBER provide reasonable binding strengths at reduced computational costs, and therefore will be useful techniques for considering larger models.",

This is illustrated for a molecule (a conformer of the Tyr-Gly dipeptide) for which B3LYP/6-31+G(d) and MP2/6-31+G(d) geometry optimizations yield strikingly different structures [Mol. Phys. 2006, 104, 559-570]: MP2 predicts a folded “closed-book” conformer with the glycine residue located above the tyrosine ring, whereas B3LYP predicts a more open conformation. By employing different levels of theory, including the local electron correlation methods LMP2 (local MP2) and LCCSD(T0) (local coupled cluster with single, double, and noniterative local triple excitations) and large basis sets (aug-cc-pVnZ, n = D, T, Q), it is shown that the folded MP2 minimum is an artifact caused by large intramolecular BSSE (basis set superposition error) effects in the MP2/6-31+G(d) calculations. The B3LYP functional gives the correct minimum, but the potential energy apparently rises too steeply when the glycine and tyrosine residues approach each other, presumably due to missing dispersion effects in the B3LYP calculations. The PWB6K and M052X functionals, designed to give good results for weak interactions, remedy this to some extent. The reduced BSSE in the LMP2 calculations leads to faster convergence with increasing basis set quality, and accurate results can be obtained with smaller basis sets as compared to canonical MP2.

Recent evidence, however, suggests that a rather wide structural range of small non-fused ring molecules may also be capable of partial or complete DNA intercalation in mammalian cells. The present paper will review recent studies on the identiﬁcation and characterization of such atypically-structured molecules utilizing both cell-based and three-dimensional computational analyses focusing principally on prediction and detection of these atypical molecules. Mechanistic aspects of genotoxicity of such non-covalent binding molecules, with emphasis on marketed pharmaceuticals, will also be discussed. A review and presentation of new data using catalytic DNA topo II inhibitors, conﬁrms the notion that topoisomerase II poisoning arising via intercalation is the major mechanism of genotoxicity of these drugs.",

In line with previous studies, most standard density functionals recover, at best, only part of the favorable stacking interactions. An exception is the new KT1 functional, which correctly yields bound π-stacked structures.

Furthermore we carried out molecular dynamics simulations enforcing the self-dissociation reaction of the water dimer to study the influence of the basis set onto the reaction. Not surprisingly, we find strongly varying results of the calculated forces for a chosen cutoff along the reaction coordinates. The basis set superposition errors of the dimer interaction energy are analyzed along the free-energy surface, i.e., along the trajectories. Based on the analysis along the trajectories a qualitative and quantitative estimate depending on the particular point of the free-energy surface can be provided. Namely, at the intermolecular O center dot center dot center dot H distance close to the equilibrium geometry the errors are smaller than at shorter O center dot center dot center dot H distances. However, the distribution at the equilibrium distance is more unsymmetrical than the distribution at short distances. It is wider, and the standard deviation is larger than at shorter distances where the basis set superposition error is larger.

With respect to the neat matrix, nanoparticle dispersion has been shown to enhance physical (e.g., barrier, erosion resistance, and reduced flammability), thermomechanical (e.g., heat distortion temperature, thermal expansion coefficient, and stiffness), and processing (e.g., surface finish and melt strength) characteristics. Beyond maximization of the nanoparticle dispersion, however, the morphology of these materials is many times uncontrolled, yielding isotropic nanofilled systems, not necessarily spatially “engineered, designed and tailored” materials. To impact high-technology applications requiring unique electrical, thermal, and optical properties, manufacturing techniques enabling control of the nanoparticle arrangement and distribution must be developed. This paper will examine the status of approaches for directing the hierarchical morphology of nanoparticle dispersions in three dimensions, and beyond uniaxial alignment, using examples from the literature to highlight the potential and issues. Ultimately, two general approaches to this challenge are emerging, namely, external-in (directed patterning of nanoparticle dispersions) and internal-out (mesophase assembly of nanoparticles).",

Two kinds of hydrophobic nanoparticles are studied: one is that the particles are selective to hydrophobic blocks but are incompatible with hydrophilic blocks, and the other is that the particles are nonselective to hydrophobic and hydrophilic blocks. For both cases, the self-association of amphiphilic block copolymer/nanoparticle mixture is observed, and the nanoparticles are spatially organized in the clusters. The aggregate morphologies can be tuned by the particle radius and particle volume fraction. For the selective particles, the aggregate morphologies of amphiphilic block copolymer/nanoparticle mixture can experience a transition from vesicles to mixture of circlelike and rod micelles as the particle radius and/or particle volume fraction increase. For the nonselective nanoparticles, the large compound micelles are produced instead of the vesicles. The large compound micelles transform to the mixture of large compound micelles and circle-like micelles with an increase in particle volume fraction and/or radius. The distribution of nanoparticles in the clusters is also affected by the particle radius and volume fraction. For both cases, when the values of nanoparticle radius and/or volume fraction are small, the nanoparticles are almost uniformly distributed in the cores of micelles.

In Section 3, we discuss results of equilibrium molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations of polymer chains in the presence of nanoparticles. After a concise theoretical description, these are compared with those obtained from integral equation and density functional approaches (Section 4).

'the planar optimized structures turn out to be transition states presenting one or more large imaginary frequencies, whereas single-determinant-based methods lead to the expected planar minima and no imaginary frequencies. It has been suggested that such anomalous behavior can be originated by two-electron basis set incompleteness error. In this work, we show that the reported pitfalls can be interpreted in terms of intramolecular basis set superposition error (BSSE) effects, mostly between the C-H moieties constituting the arenes. We have carried out counterpoise-corrected optimizations and frequency calculations at the Hartree-Fock, B3LYP, MP2, and CISD levels of theory With several basis sets for a number of arenes. In all cases, correcting for intramolecular BSSE fixes the anomalous behavior of the correlated methods, whereas no significant differences are observed in the single-determinant case. Consequently, all systems studied are planar at all levels of theory. The effect of different intramolecular fragment definitions and the particular case of charged species, namely, cyclopentadienyl and indenyl anions, respectively, are also discussed.

The intercalation interaction of protonated daunomycin with two stacked DNA base pairs was studied through a hybrid approach in which intercalation is treated at LDA/TZP while the molecular structure of daunomycin and hydrogen-bonded Watson-Crick pairs is computed at BP86/TZ2P. We find that the affinity of the drug for the six considered base pair dimers decreases in the order AT-AT > AT-TA > GC-AT > GC-TA > GC-CG > GC-GC, in excellent agreement with experimental data on the thermodynamics of the interaction between daunomycin and synthetic polynucleotides in aqueous solution.

The tilted T-shaped structure having C-s symmetry was determined to be a global minimum on the benzene-dimer potential energy surface (PES), approximately 0.1 kcal/mol more stable than the parallel-displaced structure. A fully optimized set of ten stationary points on the benzene-dimer PES is proposed for the evaluation of the reliability of methods for the description of weakly interacting systems.",

Metal ion loading of the P2VP block with simple aqueous solutions of anionic metal complexes is accomplished via protonation of this basic block, rendering it cationic; electrostatic attraction leads to a high local concentration of metal complexes within the protonated P2VP domain. A subsequent brief plasma treatment simultaneously removes the polymer and produces metallic nanowires. The morphology of the patterns can modulated by controlling solution concentration, deposition time, and molecular weight of the block copolymers, as well as other factors. Horizontal metallic nanoarrays can be aligned on e-beam lithographically deﬁned silicon substrates within different shapes, via graphoepitaxy.

The dependence of intermolecular interaction energies on the pairs of step parameters (shift, slide, rise, tilt, roll and twist) was determined. The values of these parameters were chosen to cover the whole range of variability appearing crystallographic data. The scanning procedure was performed by subsequent changes of two variables with fixed values of the remaining base-pair and base-step BDNA parameters. Additionally, the hybrid variational-perturbational scheme was applied for the decomposition of the interaction energy into physically meaningful contributions at the MP2 level of theory. The significant impact of the mutual orientations of guanine bases was observed not only on the total intermolecular energy but also on its components. The second-order dispersion interaction is the most significant contribution to stabilization energy and is about eight times larger compared to the first-order electrostatic term with relaxation effects, which is also of stabilizing character. The dispersion interactions may vary up to 9.6 kcal mol(-1) between different guanine-guanine conformations. The parameters de. ning the mutual orientation of stacked guanine molecules have a different impact on the stabilization of the investigated complex. The following base-step parameters have only a minor impact on the stabilization energies: shift-slide, shift-roll, shift-twist, slide-twist and roll-twist.

The validity of the proposed approach is addressed by applying it to study systems whose description within existing approaches would be demanding.

Properties of B+-H2 and the related Li+-H2, Na+-H2, and Al+-H2 complexes are explored through ab initio calculations at the MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ level.

	abstract = "The supermolecular second order Møller-Plesset (MP2) intermolecular interaction energy is corrected by employing time-dependent density functional (TDDFT) response theory. This is done by replacing the uncoupled second order dispersion contribution contained in the supermolecular MP2 energy with the coupled dispersion energy obtained from the TDDFT approach. Preliminary results for the rare gas dimers He2, Ne2, and Ar2 and a few structures of the (HF)2 and (H2O)2 dimers show that the conventional MP2 interaction energies are considerably improved by this procedure if compared to coupled cluster singles doubles with perturbative triples [CCSD(T)] interaction energies. However, the quality of the interaction energies obtained in this way strongly depends on the exchange-correlation potential employed in the monomer calculations: It is shown that an exact exchange-only potential surprisingly often performs better than an asymptotically corrected hybrid exchange-correlation potential. Therefore the method proposed in this work is similar to the method by Cybulski and Lytle [J. Chem. Phys., 127, 141102 (2007)] which corrects the supermolecular MP2 energies with a scaled dispersion energy from time-dependent Hartree–Fock. The results in this work are also compared to the combination of density functional theory and intermolecular perturbation theory.",

A change in binding specificity from avian alpha 2-3 to human alpha 2-6 receptor is essential for optimal human-to-human transmission and pandemics. Therefore, it is important to reveal the key factors governing the binding affinity of HA-receptor complex at the molecular level for the understanding and prediction of influenza pandemics. In this work, on the basis of ab initio fragment molecular orbital (FMO) method, we have carried out the interaction energy analysis of HA-receptor complexes to quantitatively elucidate the binding specificity of HAs to avian and human receptors. To discuss the binding property of influenza HA comprehensively, a number of HAs from human H1, swine H1, avian H3 and avian H5 viruses were analyzed. We performed detailed investigations about the interaction patterns of complexes of various HAs and receptor analogues, and revealed that intra-molecular interactions between conserved residues in HA play an important role for HA-receptor binding. These results may provide a hint to understand the role of conserved acidic residues at the receptor binding site which are destabilized by the electrostatic repulsion with sialic acid. The calculated binding energies and interaction patterns between receptor and HAs are consistent with the binding specificities of each HA and thus explain the receptor binding mechanism. The calculated results in the present analysis have provided a number of viewpoints regarding the models for the HA-receptor binding specificity associated with mutated residues. Examples include the role of Glu190 and Gln226 for the binding specificity of H5 HA. Since H5 HA has not yet been adapted to human receptor and the mechanism of the specificity change is unknown, this result is helpful for the prediction of the change in receptor specificity associated with forthcoming possible pandemics.",

Both the atomic orbital integrals and the corresponding CC coefﬁcients are broken up into smaller blocks to diminish the memory requirement. Integrals are presorted to make their sparsity pattern more regular. This allows the simultaneous use of two normally conﬂicting techniques for speeding up the CCSD procedure: the use of highly efﬁcient dense matrix multiplication routines and the efﬁcient utilization of sparsity. We also describe an efﬁcient parallel implementation of the perturbative triples correction to CCSD and related methods. Using the Array Files tool for distributed ﬁlesystems, parallelization is straightforward and does not compromise efﬁciency.

	abstract = "Effectiveness of various extrapolation schemes in predicting complete basis set (CBS) values of interaction energies has been investigated for the helium dimer as a function of interatomic separation R. The investigations were performed separately for the leading dispersion and exchange contributions to the interaction energy and for the interaction energy computed using the coupled cluster method with single and double excitations (CCSD). For all these contributions, practically exact reference values were obtained from Gaussian-type geminal calculations. Sequences of orbital basis sets augmented with diffuse and bond functions or augmented with two sets of diffuse functions have been employed, with the cardinal numbers up to X = 7. The functional form EX = ECBS + A(X − k)−α was applied for the extrapolations, where EX is the contribution to the interaction energy computed with a basis set of cardinal number X. The main conclusion of this work is that CBS extrapolations of an appropriate functional form generally improve the accuracy of the interaction energies at a very small additional computational cost (of the order of 10\%) and should be recommended in calculations of interatomic and intermolecular potentials. The effectiveness of the extrapolations signiﬁcantly depends, however, on the interatomic separation R and on the composition of the basis set. Basis sets with midbond functions, well known to provide at a given size much more accurate nonextrapolated results than bases lacking such functions, have been found to perform best also in extrapolations. The X −1 extrapolations of dispersion energies computed with midbond function turned out to be very efﬁcient (except at large R), reducing the errors by an order of magnitude for small X and a factor of two for large X (where the errors of nonextrapolated results are already very small). If midbond functions are not used, the X −3 formula is most appropriate for the dispersion energies. For the exchange component of the interaction energy, the best results are obtained—in both types of basis sets—with the X −4 extrapolation, which leads (in both cases) to almost an order of magnitude reduction of the error. The X −3 and (X − 1)−3 extrapolations work also well, but give smaller improvements. The correlation component of the CCSD interaction energy extrapolates best with α between 2 and 3 for bases with midbond functions and between 3 and 4 for bases without such functions.",

The DFT predicts periodic spacing of lamellar structures in good agreement with molecular dynamics simulations. With the polymer structure from DFT as the input, the PDT is used to examine the effects of particle size, surface energy, polymer chain length, and compressibility on the distribution of nanoparticles in the limit of low particle density. It is found that the nanoparticle distribution depends not only on the particle size and surface energy but also in the local structure of the microdomain interface, polymer chain length, and compressibility.

We provide an overview of the principles of stability and where available the experimental data that report on these principles. Significant gaps in the literature have been identified, that should be filled by a systematic study of well-defined quadruplexes not only to provide the basic understanding of stability both for design purposes, but also as it relates to in vivo occurrence of quadruplexes. Techniques that are commonly applied to the determination of the structure, stability and folding are discussed in terms of information content and limitations. Quadruplex structures fold and unfold comparatively slowly, and {DNA} unwinding events associated with transcription and replication may be operating far from equilibrium. The kinetics of formation and resolution of quadruplexes, and methodologies are discussed in the context of stability and their possible biological occurrence.",

The blends are modeled as a mixture of hard spheres and freely jointed hard chains, near a hard wall. There is a ﬁrst order phase transition present in these blends in which the nanoparticles expel the polymer from the surface to form a monolayer at a certain nanoparticle concentration. The nanoparticle transition density depends on the length of the polymer, the nanoparticle diameter, and the overall bulk density of the system. The phase transition is due to both packing entropy effects related to size asymmetry between the components and to the polymer conﬁgurational entropy, justifying the so-called “entropic push” observed in experiments. In addition, a layered state is found at higher densities which resembles that in colloidal crystals, in which the polymer and nanoparticles form alternating discrete layers. We show that this laminar state has nearly the same free energy as the homogeneously mixed ﬂuid in the bulk and is nucleated by the surface.",

In the present investigation the method is used to determine the free energy penalty DF(R, D) for placing a spherical particle with an arbitrary radius R at different positions D between the grafting plane and the brush surface. Deep inside the brush, or for dense brushes, one ﬁnds DF f R3 whereas for shallow nanoclusions DF f R2, regardless of the particle interaction (attractive/repulsive) with the polymer. The pressure and density ﬁelds around spherical nanoinclusions in a polymer brush are also investigated. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations show that the force, exerted on the particle by the surrounding brush, depends essentially on the proximity of the nanocolloid particle to the brush surface not only in strength but also with respect to its angular distribution. For shallow nanoinclusions close to the brush surface this angular distribution is shown to result in a growing buoyant force while deep inside the brush this effect is negligible.",

These allow a molecular level understanding of aspects of the thermodynamics, {DNA} structural changes, and kinetic pathways of the intercalation process. Key {DNA} structural changes involve opening the future intercalation site base pairs toward the minor groove (positive roll), followed by an increase in the rise, accompanied by hydrogen bonding changes of the minor groove waters. The calculated intercalation free energy change is −12.3 kcal/mol, in reasonable agreement with the experimental estimate −9.4 kcal/mol.

The mathematical structure of the force field, the generation of reference data, the choice of the figure of merit, the optimization algorithm, and the parameter-refinement strategy are discussed in detail.

The tailor-made force field obtained for cyclohexane-1,4-dione is used to search for low-energy crystal packings in all 230 space groups with one molecule per asymmetric unit, and the most stable crystal structures are reoptimized in a second step with the hybrid method. The experimental crystal structure is found as the most stable predicted crystal structure both with the tailor-made force field and the hybrid method.

Nonetheless, the electivity of this kind of antitumor compound has yet to be improved in order to suppress the side effects caused by nonselective binding. As drug design targets, the topology and structural characteristics of quadruplexes, their possible biological roles, and the modes and sites of small-ligand binding to these structures should be understood clearly. Herein we provide a summary of published research that has set out to address the above problem to provide useful information on the design of small ligands that target G-quadruplexes. This review also covers research methodologies that have been developed to study the binding of ligands to G-quadruplexes.",

As the local dipole contribution can be decomposed in polarization and charge transfer components, our results indicate that local dipolar polarization of the lone pairs and chemical reactivity are closely related whereas the charge transfer contribution is the key factor driving the local bond dipole. Results on relevant molecules show that local dipole contributions can be used to rationalize inductive polarization effects in alcohols derivatives and typical hydrogen bond interactions. Moreover, bond quadrupole polarization moments being related to a pi character enable to discuss bond multiplicities, and to sort families of molecules according to their bond order. That way, the nature of the {C\&bond;O} bond has been revisited for several typical systems by means of the {DEMEP} analysis which appears also helpful to discuss aromaticity. Special attention has been given to the carbon monoxide molecule, to the {CuCO} complex and to a weak intramolecular {N{\textbar}—CO} interaction involved in several biological systems. In this latter case, it is confirmed that the bond formation is mainly linked to the {CO} bond polarization. Transferability tests show that the approach is suitable for the design of advanced force fields. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Comput Chem 2008",

The geometries of these structures were obtained via an all-coordinate gradient geometry optimization using the DFT-D/BLYP method, covering the empirical dispersion correction fitted exclusively for this system. The fit was carried out against two estimated CCSD(T)/CBS potential energy curves corresponding to the distance variation between two benzene rings for the parallel-displaced (PD) and T-shaped (T) structures. The effect of the connected quadruple excitations on the interaction energy was estimated using the CCSD(TQ(f)) method in a 6-31 G*(0.25) basis set, destabilizing the T and T-shaped tilted (TT) structures by approximate to 0.02 kcal/mol and the PD structure by approximate to 0.04 kcal/mol.

Three models with increasingly accurate molecular multipoles (accurate quadrupole, octopole, and hexadecapole moments, respectively) are developed and used in molecular dynamics simulations. All models with a ﬂuctuating quadrupole moment correctly describe the location of the B-state whereas the sign of the octopole moment differentiates between the FeáááCO and FeáááOC orientation. For the infrared spectrum of photodissociated CO, considerable differences between the three electrostatic models are found.

Instead of conventional force fields, anharmonic potentials are used for the bonded interactions. The electrostatic interactions are more accurately described by means of fluctuating atomic multipole moments (up to quadrupole). The experimentally observed splitting of the CO absorption band (gas phase: 2143 cmÀ1) into a blue- (2152 cmÀ1) and a red-shifted (2138 cmÀ1) signal is also found in the simulations. Complementary atomistic simulations allow us to relate the spectra with the structural features. The distinction between interstitial and substitutional CO molecules as the origin of this splitting is found to be qualitatively correct.

The fundamental scientiﬁc and industrial interest in controlling crystallisation is inspiring the development of computational methods of predicting which crystal structures are thermodynamically feasible. Sometimes, computing this crystal energy landscape will reveal that a molecule has one way of packing with itself that is suﬃciently more favourable than any other so only this crystal structure will be observed. More frequently, there will be many energy minima that are energetically feasible, showing approximately equi-energetic compromises between the various intermolecular interactions allowed by the conformational ﬂexibility. Such cases generally lead to multiple solid forms. At the moment, we usually calculate the lattice energy landscape, an approximation to the real crystal energy landscape at 0 K. Despite its limitations, many studies show that this is a valuable complement to solid form screening, which helps in discovering new structures as well as rationalising the solid forms that are found in experimental searches. The range of factors that can determine which of the thermodynamically feasible crystal structures are observed polymorphs, shows the many further challenges in developing crystal energy landscapes as a tool for control of the organic solid state.",

The potential energy surfaces of dimers were searched as a function of the vertical separation, angle of rotation and horizontal displacement between monomers stacked according to their centers of mass. Our calculations reveal that the stacking interactions of adducts for a given nucleobase are dependent on the methylation site (by up to 20 kJ mol(-1)), where the relative magnitudes of the interactions are determined by the dipole moments of the adducts and the proton affinities of nucleobase methylation sites. Nevertheless, the differences in the (gas-phase) stacking of methylated adducts are small compared with the differences between the stacking of the corresponding natural and methylated nucleobases. Indeed, methylation increases the stacking energy by up to 40 kJ mol(-1) (or 135\%). Although immersing the dimers in different solvents decreases the gas-phase stacking energies with an increase in the polarity of the environment, base methylation still has a significant effect on the nucleobase stacking ability in solvents with large dipole moments, and, perhaps more importantly, environments that mimic enzyme active sites. Our results shed light on the workings of DNA repairs enzymes that selectively remove a wide variety of alkylated nucleobases over the natural bases.",

This issue is rarely discussed in quantum chemical and physical chemistry literature. We further extensively discuss methods that are available for base-stacking studies, complexity of comparison of stacking calculations with gas phase experiments, balance of forces in stacked complexes of nucleic acid bases, and the relation between QM and force field descriptions. We also review all recent calculations on base- stacking systems, including details analysis of the B-DNA stacking. Specific attention is paid to the highest accuracy QM calculations, to the decomposition of the interactions, and development of dispersion-balanced DFT methods.

The knowledge of electrostatic, exchange, delocalization, and correlation components of the transition state and substrates stabilization energy arising from each enzyme active site residue allows to examine the most essential physical effects involved in enzymatic catalysis. Consequently, one can build approximate models of the catalytic activity in a systematic and legitimate manner. Whenever the dominant role of electrostatic interactions is recognized or assumed, the properties of an optimal catalytic environment could be simply generalized and visualized by means of catalytic ﬁelds that, in turn, aids the design of new catalysts. Differential transition state stabilization (DTSS) methodology has been applied herein to the phosphoryl transfer reaction catalyzed by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). The MP2 results correlate well with the available experimental data and theoretical ﬁndings indicating that Lys72, Asp166, and the two magnesium ions contribute -22.7, -13.3, -32.4, and -15.2 kcal/mol to differential transition state stabilization, respectively. Although all interaction energy components except that of electron correlation contribution are meaningful, the ﬁrst-order electrostatic term correlates perfectly with MP2 catalytic activity. Catalytic ﬁeld technique was also employed to visualize crucial electrostatic features of an ideal catalyst and to compare the latter with the environment provided by PKA active site. The map of regional electronic chemical potential was used to analyze the unfavorable catalytic effect of Lys168. It was found that locally induced polarization of TS atoms thermodynamically destabilizes electrons, pulling them to regions displaying higher electronic chemical potential.",

It can dramatically affect the energy differences between various conformers as well as intramolecular stabilities, and it can even impair the accuracy of the predictions of the equilibrium molecular structures. In this study, we will present two extreme cases of intramolecular BSSE, the internal stability of [n]helicene molecules and the relative energies of various conformers of phenylalanyl-glycyl-phenylalanine tripeptide (Phe-Gly-Phe), and compare the calculated data with benchmark values (experimental or high-level theoretical data). As a practical and cheap solution to the accurate treatment of the systems with large anticipated value of intramolecular BSSE, the recently developed density functional method augmented with an empirical dispersion term (DFT-D) is proposed and shown to provide very good results in both of the above described representative cases.

A very strong preferential interfacial interaction suppressed the electric-ﬁeld-induced S-to-C transition even though such a transition occurred on a neutralized surface where the interfacial interactions were balanced. For a moderate interfacial interaction, the S-to-C transition can be induced by an applied electric ﬁeld, but the time scale of the morphology change is much longer. Furthermore, the formation of ionic complexes in the BCP was found to enhance the electric-ﬁeld-induced S-to-C transition even on a native Si substrate without any surface modiﬁcation, providing a simple route to generate ordered arrays of high-aspect-ratio cylinders oriented normal to a ﬁlm surface.",

In this review, we ﬁrst introduce some computational methods that have been applied to polymer nanocomposites, covering from molecular scale (e.g., molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo), microscale (e.g., Brownian dynamics, dissipative particle dynamics, lattice Boltzmann, time-dependent Ginzburg–Landau method, dynamic density functional theory method) to mesoscale and macroscale (e.g., micromechanics, equivalent-continuum and self-similar approaches, ﬁnite element method). Then, we discuss in some detail their applications to various aspects of polymer nanocomposites, including the thermodynamics and kinetics of formation, molecular structure and dynamics, morphology, processing behaviors, and mechanical properties. Finally, we address the importance of multiscale simulation strategies in the understanding and predictive capabilities of polymer nanocomposites in which few studies have been reported.

Continued technological advances allowed for expansion from prototypical cases to mechanistic studies featuring detailed enzyme and condensed-phase environments with full integration of the {QM} calculations and configurational sampling. This required improved algorithms featuring fast {QM} methods, advances in computing changes in free energies including free-energy perturbation {(FEP)} calculations, and enhanced configurational sampling. In particular, the present Account highlights development of the {PDDG/PM3} semi-empirical {QM} method, computation of multi-dimensional potentials of mean force {(PMF),} incorporation of on-the-fly {QM} in Monte Carlo {(MC)} simulations, and a polynomial quadrature method for efficient modeling of proton-transfer reactions. The utility of this {QM/MM/MC/FEP} methodology is illustrated for a variety of organic reactions including substitution, decarboxylation, elimination, and pericyclic reactions. A comparison to experimental kinetic results on medium effects has verified the accuracy of the {QM/MM} approach in the full range of solvents from hydrocarbons to water to ionic liquids. Corresponding results from ab initio and density functional theory {(DFT)} methods with continuum-based treatments of solvation reveal deficiencies, particularly for protic solvents. Also summarized in this Account are three specific {QM/MM} applications to biomolecular systems: (1) a recent study that clarified the mechanism for the reaction of 2-pyrone derivatives catalyzed by macrophomate synthase as a tandem Michael−aldol sequence rather than a {Diels−Alder} reaction, (2) elucidation of the mechanism of action of fatty acid amide hydrolase {(FAAH),} an unusual {Ser-Ser-Lys} proteolytic enzyme, and (3) the construction of enzymes for Kemp elimination of 5-nitrobenzisoxazole that highlights the utility of {QM/MM} in the design of artificial enzymes.",

Theory and simulations suggest that this self-assembly reﬂects a balance between the energy gain when particle cores approach and the entropy of distorting the grafted polymers. The effectively directional nature of the particle interactions is thus a many-body emergent property.

Similarly to the case of other planar aromatic systems, these pitfalls can be explained in terms of intramolecular basis set superposition error (BSSE) effects, induced by local basis set deficiencies. We demonstrate that conventional BSSE correction techniques such as the Counterpoise method can account for this wrong behavior and provide proper correction whenever spurious results occur, mainly in case of thymine, uracil and guanine but also to lower extent for adenine and cytosine. We also show that special care must be taken when assessing the BSSE by means of ghost-orbital calculations for strongly overlapping fragments. Often molecular orbitals in the isolated fragment calculation have a different orientation as in the ghost-orbital calculation. This can lead to bogus derivatives of the CP-correction term, essential to account for geometry and vibrational BSSE effects.

We compare and correlate QM/MM results with those from QM and/or molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and discuss scope and limitations with a critical eye on current shortcomings in available methodologies and computer resources. We thus hope to foster mutual appreciation and facilitate collaboration between experimentalists and theorists to jointly advance our understanding of RNA catalysis at an atomistic level.",

In this work, we investigate the nature of the intermolecular interactions between Cl2 and Br2 with water. Our analysis of several features of {MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ-optimized} stable clusters with different number and arrangement of water molecules shows that two different kinds of halogen−water coordination patterns are involved in the stability and properties found for these systems: halogen bonds {(X−X···O)} and halogen−hydrogen interactions, {(X−X···H−O−H).} Both types of interactions result in a large polarization of the halogen molecule, which leads to important cooperative effects on these structures. Although the general structural aspects of these clusters can be understood in terms of dipole−quadrupole forces at long range, where it is the dominant term, the {SAPT} analysis shows that factors such as polarization of π densities and dispersion become increasingly important close to equilibrium. In particular, we show that the halogen−hydrogen interactions are weaker than halogen−oxygen interactions mainly due to the electrostatic and dispersion forces. We also calculate vibrational and electronic shifts that should be helpful for the interpretation of experimental results and for investigating the microsolvation phenomena for halogens in an aqueous environment.",

While the single-stranded sequences displayed a simple monoexponential kinetic behavior, the binding of {7AAMD} to {HP1} at {\textless}30 {°C} was biphasic and could be rationalized in terms of a sequential formation of two isomeric bound forms or alternatively in terms of an {ssHP1−hpHP1} equilibrium, with both {HP1} forms reacting with {7AAMD.} The rates of complex dissociation induced by the detergent {SDS} were also measured.

	abstract = "Field-theoretic models, which replace interactions between polymers with interactions between polymers and one or more conjugate ﬁelds, offer a systematic framework for coarse-graining of complex ﬂuids systems. While this approach has been used successfully to investigate a wide range of polymer formulations at equilibrium, ﬁeld-theoretic models often fail to accurately capture the non-equilibrium behavior of polymers, especially in the early stages of phase separation. Here the ‘‘two-ﬂuid” approach serves as a useful alternative, treating the motions of ﬂuid components separately in order to incorporate asymmetries between polymer molecules. In this work we focus on the connection of these two theories, drawing upon the strengths of each of the approaches in order to couple polymer microstructure with the dynamics of the ﬂow in a systematic way. For illustrative purposes we work with an inhomogeneous melt of elastic dumbbell polymers, though our methodology will apply more generally to a wide variety of inhomogeneous systems. First we derive the model, incorporating thermodynamic forces into a two-ﬂuid model for the ﬂow through the introduction of conjugate chemical potential and elastic strain ﬁelds for the polymer density and stress. The resulting equations are composed of a system of fourth order PDEs coupled with a non-linear, non-local optimization problem to determine the conjugate ﬁelds. The coupled system is severely stiff and with a high degree of computational complexity. Next, we overcome the formidable numerical challenges posed by the model by designing a robust semi-implicit method based on linear asymptotic behavior of the leading order terms at small scales, by exploiting the exponential structure of global (integral) operators, and by parallelizing the non-linear optimization problem. The semi-implicit method effectively removes the fourth order stability constraint associated with explicit methods and we observe only a ﬁrst order time-step restriction. The algorithm for solving the non-linear optimization problem, which takes advantage of the form of the operators being optimized, reduces the overall simulation time by several orders of magnitude. We illustrate the methodology with several examples of phase separation in an initially quiescent ﬂow.",

Systematic (MP2/6-31G*(0.25)) potential energy surface scans reveal important information about the eﬀects of the deoxyribose sugar and protein backbone on the structure and binding energy between truncated nucleobase and amino acid models that are typically implemented in the literature. Most notably, electrostatic and steric interactions arising from the bulkiness of the biological backbones can change the preferred relative orientations of DNA and protein p-systems. More importantly, the protein backbone can strengthen the stacking energy (by up to 10 kJ molÀ1), while the deoxyribose moiety can strengthen or weaken the stacking interaction depending on the positioning of the amino acid relative to the sugar residue. These eﬀects are likely due to additional interactions between the amino acid or nucleobase ring and the backbone in the extended monomer rather than signiﬁcant changes in the properties of the biological p-systems upon model extension. Since the present work reveals that all calculated DNA–protein stacking interactions are signiﬁcant and approach the strength of other noncovalent interactions between biomolecules, both p–p and backbone–p interactions must be considered when attempting to gain a complete picture of DNA–protein binding.",

In the case of all of the studied neutral complexes, the main source of stabilization is the delocalizaction energy associated with the electron density deformation upon the interaction which contributes almost half of the total interaction energy. Furthermore, analysis of the interaction induced difference density maps of complexes containing neutral amino acid side chains reveals that the delocalization component involves the electron density changes localized in the double-hydrogen-bonded ring structures.

Participants were challenged to predict the crystal structures of the four systems, given only their molecular diagrams, while the recently determined but as-yet unpublished crystal structures were withheld by an independent referee. Three predictions were allowed for each system. The results demonstrate a dramatic improvement in rates of success over previous blind tests; in total, there were 13 successful predictions and, for each of the four targets, at least two groups correctly predicted the observed crystal structure. The successes include one participating group who correctly predicted all four crystal structures as their ﬁrst ranked choice, albeit at a considerable computational expense. The results reﬂect important improvements in modelling methods and suggest that, at least for the small and fairly rigid types of molecules included in this blind test, such calculations can be constructively applied to help understand crystallization and polymorphism of organic molecules.",

	abstract = "The diacetylene dimer, (H–C C–C C–H)2, serves as a useful prototype for delocalised -type interactions. It mimics many of the important characteristics of aromatic -stacking prototypes such as (C6H6)2 but is small enough that full geometry optimisations and vibrational frequency computations with analytic derivatives are feasible with sophisticated electronic structure techniques. Six stationary points on the potential energy surface (PES) of (H–C C–C C–H)2 have been identified and characterised with CCSD(T) computations. The relative energies of the stationary points on each PES have been anchored by combining explicitly correlated MP2-R12 computations with corrections for higher-order correlation effects as well as core correlation effects. These computations identify a Y-shaped global minimum with an electronic dissociation energy (De) of 1.84 kcal molÀ1 at the all-electron CCSD(T) complete basis set limit. Higher-order correlation corrections are necessary to correctly identify the global minimum while core correlation effects have almost no influence on the relative energies of the stationary points.",

A consideration of enthalpic and entropic interactions is necessary when physically or chemically distinct NRs are introduced into the copolymer/nanorod composites. For the short NRs, the phase behavior is similar to that of spherical nanoparticles (NPs). For the long NRs, the self-assembly of NRs can inﬂuence both the orientation and morphology of diblock/nanorod mixtures. If more NRs are incorporated, under stronger conﬁnement from the host phase separated domains, the long NRs will aggregate and self-assemble into a certain spatial organization, inducing the morphological transitions of the composites from one phase to another. This behavior is not encountered for a similar system doped with spherical particles, emphasizing the role of particle shape in the interaction between doping particles and the host phase.",

By comparison with X-ray crystal structures, we have identified similarities and differences between intercalated 3′,5′ and 2′,5′-linked {RNA} duplexes. First, the two forms of {RNA} have different sugar pucker geometries at the intercalated nucleotide steps, yet have the same interphosphate distances. Second, as in intercalated 3′,5′ {RNA,} the phosphate backbone angle ζ at the 2′,5′ {RNA} intercalation site prefers to be in the trans conformation, whereas unintercalated 2′,5′ and 3′,5′ {RNA} prefer the -gauche conformation. These observations provide new insights regarding the transitions required for intercalation of a phosphodiester-ribose backbone and suggest a possible contribution of the backbone to the origin of the nearest-neighbor exclusion principle.

To test whether this can be predicted with a current computational methodology, we compare the lattice energies of 12 cocrystals of 4-aminobenzoic acid, 8 of succinic acid and 6 of caffeine, with the sums of the lattice energies of their components. These three molecules were chosen for their potential use in pharmaceutical cocrystals and because they had sufﬁcient determinations of cocrystals and corresponding partner crystal structures in the Cambridge Structural Database. The lattice energies were evaluated using anisotropic intermolecular atom-atom potentials, with the electrostatic model and the intramolecular energy penalty for changes in speciﬁed torsion angles derived from ab initio calculations on the isolated molecules. The majority of the cocrystals are calculated to be more stable than their components, but the energy difference is only large in a few of the cases where the partner molecule cannot hydrogen bond to itself. More typically, the cocrystal stabilization is comparable to polymorphic energy differences and some of the speciﬁcally identiﬁed errors in the computational modeling. The cocrystals will be more stable relative to the observed disordered structures of caffeine and the kinetically preferred polymorph of 4-aminobenzoic acid, highlighting kinetic factors that may be involved in cocrystal formation. Overall, it appears that cocrystal formation should generally be predictable by comparing the relative stability of the most stable cocrystal and its pure components found on the computed crystal energy landscapes, but this is often very demanding of the accuracy of the method used to calculate the crystal energy.",

Toward a quantitative description of the composite structure and associated thermo-mechanical properties from a molecular perspective, we examined the performance of a nonlocal density functional theory that accounts for the excluded-volume effects and intra- and inter-chain correlations self-consistently. It is predicted that, within the lamellar structures of symmetric block copolymers, neutral particles are localized at the microdomain interface, leading to a reduction of the lamellar thickness. Conversely, particles that are energetically biased to a particular microdomain expand the block copolymer lamellar structure. The dilation or shrinkage of the lamellar thickness also depends on the particle packing density. Both particle dispersion and particle-polymer interfacial structure are highly sensitive to the ratio of the particle diameter to the lamellar thickness. While small nanoparticles may either increase or reduce the extensional moduli of the composite material depending on the nanoparticle volume fraction and polymer-particle interactions, large particles always enhance the mechanical properties regardless of the polymer-particle interactions. The theoretical predictions are found to be in qualitative agreement with simulation results and experiments.",

We consider two different kinds of spherical NPs categorized with respect to their interaction potential with the polymeric blocks: 1 selective NPs that show a preference toward one of the blocks of a model diblock copolymer and 2 nonselective NPs that show equal attraction toward both blocks. For unrestricted simulation times during elongational ﬂow, spatially and temporally periodic boundary conditions devised by Kraynik and Reinelt Int. J. Multiphase Flow 18, 1045 1992 have been implemented. Our results show that the concentration peak of both selective NPs at the center of the preferred domain and nonselective NPs at the domain interface becomes broader with increasing elongation rate, suggesting that elongational ﬂow can be used as another parameter to control nanocomposite self-assembly. In addition, our results reveal that the onset of ﬂow-induced transition from lamellar to disordered morphology is greatly inﬂuenced by particle-particle and particle-polymer interactions.",

Implications of these results for modeling hydrogen bond acidity, derivation of atomic charges, and development of polarizable force ﬁelds were discussed.",

X-ray scattering shows that the distribution of particle spacings in the semicrystalline state is always significantly broader than in the melt, even though the mean particle spacing is unchanged. We thus conclude that, at low loadings, the polymer “forces” the nanoparticle “defects” out of their way to crystallize in a minimally perturbed form. For higher loadings, the crystals become smaller in response to increased particle induced confinement. In contrast to currently held views that the particles control the crystallization process, e.g., by providing heterogeneous nucleation sites, we find that the crystalline lamellae dominate; i.e., they manipulate the nanoparticle dispersion, especially at low loadings.",

Our approach of varying the areal chain density (Σ) of short thiol terminated polystyrene (PS-SH) brushes on the particles where the molecular weight (Mn) of the PS ligands (2.5 kg/mol) is used to control the fraction of the particles adsorbed to the interface of PS-b-P2VP diblock copolymer domains (Mn = 196 kg/mol). The change in Σ from 2.38 to 0.49 chains/nm2 brings systematic control over the fraction of Au particles bound to the PS/P2VP interface ( fi), this fraction ranging from 0 to 95\%. Particles with Σ of 2.38 chains/nm2 ( fi ∼ 0) were observed to localize within the PS domains and further produce a macroscopic particle aggregated phase separate from the PS-b-P2VP mesophase. In contrast, decreasing the Σ of PS chains provides for strong binding of Au nanoparticles to the PS/P2VP interfaces as a consequence of preferential wetting of one block of the copolymer (P2VP) to the Au substrate. Interestingly, the addition of low volume fractions (φP) of such nanoparticle surfactants (Σ < 1.1 chains/nm2) to lamellar diblock copolymers initially leads to a decrease in lamellar thickness, a consequence of decreasing interfacial tension, up to a critical value of φP beyond which the block copolymer adopts a bicontinuous morphology. The relationship between domain spacing and morphology of block copolymer with the level of nanoparticle surfactants will be discussed based on a strong-segregation model. In addition, the rational design of nanoparticle surfactants based on the nature and density of the grafted chains will be described.",

Two types of complex were considered in this study: a singly coordinated system (SCS) and a doubly coordinated system (DCS). Complexation energies were calculated both without and with basis set superposition error (BSSE). Because of the strong charge-dipole interactions, the complexation energies were largely negative and decreased in the order Li+ > Na+ > K+. Three possible counterpoise (CP) approaches were examined in detail. In the case of the function CP (fCP) correction, the complexation energies exhibited an unusual trend because of the deformation of the subunits. This problem was solved by including geometry relaxation in the CP-corrected (GCP) interaction energies. The effects on the structures and vibrational frequencies were small when the complexes were reoptimized on the CP-corrected potential energy surface-(PES).

For particles with approximately constant effective size (defined here as the ratio of filler particle diameter to host polymer radius of gyration), miscibility was observed only within diblock copolymers and within the domains formed by the end blocks of triblock copolymers. The limitation of particle miscibility within the triblock mid-domain is interpreted as a consequence of the entropy loss associated with particle deposition due to the stretched configuration of bridged midblock chains. Particle aggregation was observed in both star copolymer samples irrespective of the architecture of the particle-loaded polymer domain. In the case of particle loading of the branched copolymer domain, this is rationalized as a consequence of the increased effective particle size, whereas the incompatibility of particle fillers in the linear block domain of miktoarm copolymer hosts is interpreted as a result of the coupling of dimensional changes within the microstructure along with the reduced axial compressibility of the particle-free branched domain. The sensitive dependence of the particle compatibility on the chain architecture of the polymer host illustrates a yet unexplored parameter space that will need to be taken into account if particle blends are to be designed with branched or multiblock host copolymer architectures.",

The treatments of our multiscale model system on an atomic scale or on a speciﬁc coarse-grained scale are carefully discussed. We perform a series of test simulations on this hybrid model system and compare the structural correlations on the atomic scale with those of classical MD simulations. The results are very encouraging and open a way to an efﬁcient strategy that possess the main advantages common to the SCF and the atomistic approaches, while avoiding the disadvantages of each of the treatments.",

The {ETS-NOCV} charge and energy decomposition scheme based on the {Kohn−Sham} approach makes it not only possible to decompose the deformation density, Δρ, into the different components (such as σ, π, δ, etc.) of the chemical bond, but it also provides the corresponding energy contributions to the total bond energy. Thus, the {ETS-NOCV} scheme offers a compact, qualitative, and quantitative picture of the chemical bond formation within one common theoretical framework. Although, the {ETS-NOCV} approach contains a certain arbitrariness in the definition of the molecular subsystems that constitute the whole molecule, it can be widely used for the description of different types of chemical bonds. The applicability of the {ETS-NOCV} scheme is demonstrated for single {(H3X−XH3,} for X = C, Si, Ge, Sn) and multiple {(H2XXH2,} {H3CXXCH3,} for X = C, Ge) covalent bonds between main group elements, for sextuple and quadruple bonds between metal centers {(Cr2,} Mo2, W2, {[Cl4CrCrCl4]4-),} and for double bonds between a metal and a main group element {((CO)5CrXH2,} for X = C, Si, Ge, Sn).

The magnitude and the effect of the basis set superposition error BSSE were carefully investigated. We found that going up to aug-cc-pVDZ and aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets is enough to obtain accurate CBS MP2 energies when BSSE corrected values are used but aug-cc-pVTZ and aug-cc-pVQZ basis sets are needed when the BSSE uncorrected total energies are used in CBS extrapolations. MP2 interaction energies with smaller basis sets such as 6-31G are found to have very little dispersion energy and that the true source of dispersion attributed attractive interactions is almost entirely due to BSSE. MP2 and CCSD T CBS interaction energies are found to be very close to one another if aromatic systems are not involved. Comparative analyses have been performed with semiempirical and ab initio methods utilizing the moderate in size but affordable 6-31G basis set both of which can be readily applied to macromolecular systems.

The calculations have been specifically aimed at geometries with unoptimized distances between the monomers including geometries with mutually tilted monomers. Such geometries are characterized by a delicate balance between local steric clashes and local unstacking and had until now not been investigated using reference quantum-mechanics (QM) methods. Nonparallel stacking geometries often occur in nucleic acids and are of decisive importance, for example, for local conformational variations in B-DNA. Errors in the short-range repulsion region would have a major impact on potential energy scans which were often used in the past to investigate local geometry variations in DNA. An incorrect description of such geometries may also partially affect molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in applications when quantitative accuracy is required. The reference OM calculations have been carried out using the MP2 method extrapolated to the complete basis-set limit and corrected for higher-order electron-correlation contributions using CCSD(T) calculations with a medium-sized basis set. These reference calculations have been used as benchmark data to test the performance of the DFT-D, SCS(MI)-MP2, and DFT-SAPT QM methods and of the AMBER molecular-mechanics (MM) force field. The QM methods show close to quantitative agreement with the reference data, albeit the DFT-D method tends to modestly exaggerate the repulsion of steric clashes. The force field in general also provides a good description of base stacking for the systems studied here. However, for geometries with close interatomic contacts and clashes, the repulsion effects are rather severely exaggerated. The discrepancy reported here should not affect the overall stability of MD simulations and qualitative applications of the force field. However, it may affect the description of subtle quantitative effects such as the local conformational variations in B-DNA. Preliminary calculations for two H-bonded uracil base pairs, including one with a C-H center dot center dot center dot OH-bond, indicate excellent performance of the tested QM methods for all intermonomer distances. The force field, on the other hand, is less satisfactory, especially in the repulsive regions.",

In the second part, we take a different look at coarse graining by analyzing conformations of molecules. This is done by the application of self-organizing maps, i.e., a neural network type approach. Such an approach can be used to guide the selection of the relevant degrees of freedom. Then, we discuss technical issues related to the popular dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) method. Importantly, the potentials derived using the inverse Monte Carlo method can be used together with the DPD thermostat. In the final part we focus on solvent-free modeling which offers a different route to coarse graining by integrating out the degrees of freedom associated with solvent.",

With all methods, results from full geometry optimizations indicate that stacking interactions increase the N7 and O6 proton affinities by about 5-6 kcal mol(-1), the increase being slightly larger for N7. Consistently with these results, hydrogen bond distances between guanine and one water molecule decrease in the stacked system. Moreover, interaction energy between H2O and (G-Tyr) is found to be 2-3 kcal mol(-1) larger than in G center dot center dot center dot H2O.

Our results conﬁrm that the ∆CCSD(T) correction converges much faster toward the complete basis set (CBS) limit than toward the MP2 or CCSD(T) energies. This justiﬁes approximating the CBS energy by adding the ∆CCSD(T) correction calculated with a modest basis set to a large basis MP2 energy. The fast convergence of the ∆CCSD(T) correction is not obvious, as the individual CCSD and (T) contributions converge less rapidly than their sum. The MP2.5 method performs very well for this system, with results very close to CCSD(T). It is conjectured that using a ∆MP2.5 correction, deﬁned analogously to ∆CCSD(T), with large basis sets may yield more reliable nonbonded interaction energies than using ∆CCSD(T) with a smaller basis set. This would result in important computational savings as the MP3 scales computationally much less steep than CCSD(T), although higher than SCS-MP2, a similar approximation.",

Crystal parameters and densities of the low-energy crystal produced by the {NsT-MD} simulations matched those of the experimental crystal to within 1\% of density and cell edge lengths and 0.01[degree] of the cell angle. The arrangement of the molecules within the time-averaged unit cell were in equally outstanding agreement with experiment, with the largest deviation of the location of the molecular mass centers being less than 0.07 {[Angstrom]} and the largest deviation in molecular orientation being less than 2.8[degree]. {NsT-MD} simulations were also used to calculate crystallographic parameters as functions of temperature and pressure and the results were in a reasonable agreement with experiment.",

	abstract = "The phenomenon of polymorphism, the ability of a molecule to adopt more than one crystal structure, is a well-established property of crystalline solids. The possible variations in physical properties between polymorphs make the reliable reproduction of a crystalline form essential for all research using organic materials, as well as quality control in manufacture. Thus, the last two decades have seen both an increase in interest in polymorphism and the availability of the computer power needed to make the computational prediction of organic crystal structures a practical possibility. In the past decade, researchers have made considerable improvements in the theoretical basis for calculating the sets of structures that are within the energy range of possible polymorphism, called crystal energy landscapes. It is common to ﬁnd that a molecule has a wide variety of ways of packing with lattice energy within a few kilojoules per mole of the most stable structure. However, as we develop methods to search for and characterize “all” solid forms, it is also now usual for polymorphs and solvates to be found. Thus, the computed crystal energy landscape reﬂects and to an increasing extent “predicts” the emerging complexity of the solid state observed for many organic molecules. This Account will discuss the ways in which the calculation of the crystal energy landscape of a molecule can be used as a complementary technique to solid form screening for polymorphs. Current methods can predict the known crystal structure, even under “blind test” conditions, but such successes are generally restricted to those structures that are the most stable over a wide range of thermodynamic conditions. The other low-energy structures can be alternative polymorphs, which have sometimes been found in later experimental studies. Examining the computed structures reveals the various compromises between close packing, hydrogen bonding, and π-π stacking that can result in energetically feasible structures. Indeed, we have observed that systems with many almost equi-energetic structures that contain a common interchangeable motif correlate with a tendency to disorder and problems with control of the crystallization product. Thus, contrasting the computed crystal energy landscape with the known crystal structures of a given molecule provides a valuable complement to solid form screening, and the examination of the low-energy structures often leads to a rationalization of the forms found.",

In this paper, we used {AutoDock} 4.0 to perform self-dockings and cross dockings between two {DNA} ligands (a minor groove binder and an intercalator) and four distinct receptors: 1) crystallographic {DNA} without intercalation gap; 2) crystallographic {DNA} with intercalation gap; 3) canonical {B-DNA;} and 4) modified {B-DNA} with intercalation gap. Besides being efficient in self-dockings, {AutoDock} is capable of correctly identifying two of the main {DNA} binding modes with the condition that the target possesses an artificial intercalation gap. Therefore, we suggest a default protocol to identify {DNA} binding modes which uses a modified canonical {DNA} (with gap) as receptor. This protocol was applied to dock two different Tröger bases to {DNA} and the predicted binding modes agree with those suggested, yet not established, by experimental data. We also applied the protocol to dock aflatoxin B1 exo-8,9-epoxide, and the results are in complete agreement with experimental data from the literature. We propose that this approach can be used to investigate other ligands whose binding mode to {DNA} remains unknown, yielding a suitable starting point for further theoretical studies such as molecular dynamics simulations.",

These types of interactions have been the subject of many recent investigations because of their potential in the development of new materials and pharmaceutical compounds. Recently, it was observed that most halogen bonding interactions in biological contexts involve close contacts between a halogen bound to an aromatic ring and a carbonyl oxygen on a protein’s backbone structure. In this work we investigate interactions of substituted bromobenzenes and bromopyrimidines with acetone to ascertain the effects of various substituents upon the strengths of these interactions. It was found that replacement of ring hydrogens in these systems has dramatic effects upon the interaction strengths of the resulting complexes, which have interaction energies between −1.80 and −7.11 kcal/mol. Examination of the electrostatic potentials of the substituted bromobenzene and bromopyrimidine monomers indicates that the addition of substituents has a large influence upon the most positive electrostatic potential on the surface of the interacting bromine and thus modulates these halogen bonding interactions. Results obtained using the symmetry-adapted perturbation theory {(SAPT)} interaction energy decomposition procedure also indicate that electrostatic interactions play the key role in these halogen bonding interactions. These results have important implications in drug design and crystal engineering.

The stabilization energies in dimers with the strongest interactions were further examined at the CCSD(T)/CBS level of theory. Results at the highest level of theory possible for these systems indicate that both stacking and T-shaped interactions are very close in magnitude to biologically relevant hydrogen bonds. Additionally, T-shaped interactions are as strong, if not stronger, than the corresponding stacking interactions. Our systematic consideration of the interaction energies in 485 possible combinations of monomers shows that a variety of these contacts are essential when considering the role of aromatic amino acids in the binding of proteins to DNA or RNA.

In this work, Quantum Molecular Similarity Measures are probed as an alternative avenue to properly quantify the electronic relaxation due to the BSSE removal by means of distance indices between the uncorrected and corrected charge densities. It is shown that BSSE contamination is more important at the DFT level of theory, and in some cases, changes on the topology of the electron density are observed upon BSSE correction.

The microsolvation effect is also considered. We note that the interaction between a cationic π system and a neutral π system (πcation-π interaction) is so far ambiguously considered as either π-π or cation-π interaction. In terms of total binding energy, the πcation-π interaction is weaker than the cation-π interaction, but much stronger than the π-π interaction. When the hydrophilic (N-H)+ or (C-H)+ group in a singly charged π+ system (as in protonated histidine, arginine, pyridine, or dimethyl imidazolium) interacts with a π-system, the complex favors a T-shaped form [π+-π(T) complex]. However, in the presence of polar solvating molecules or counteranions, these species interact with the (N-H)+/(C-H)+ group, while the π+ system interacts with the neutral aromatic ring. Then, the displaced-stacked form [π+-π(D) complex] is favored or otherwise nearly isoenergetic to the π+-π(T) form. The π+-π systems are stabilized mainly by both dispersion and electrostatic energies. Ternary diagrams using either attractive energy components or both attractive and repulsive energy components show that the π+-π(D) complexes have more contribution from dispersion energy but less contribution from induction energy than the π+-π(T) complexes, while both complexes have similar percentage contributions from electrostatic and exchange energy components.

The {Born–Oppenheimer} separation of electronic and nuclear motions lies at the heart of most modern quantum chemical models of molecular structure. While this separation introduces a great computational and practical simplification, it is neither essential to the conceptual formulation of molecular structure nor universally valid. Going beyond the {Born–Oppenheimer} approximation introduces new paradigms, bringing fresh insight into the chemistry of fluxional molecules, proteins, superconductors and macroscopic dielectrics, thus opening up new avenues for exploration. But it requires that our ideas of molecular structure need to evolve beyond simple ball-and-stick-type models.",

Spermine that electrostatically binds {DNA} induced the increase in layer thickness and decrease in the density of both native and denatured {DNA.} However, the looser structure of native {DNA} made it more accessible to spermine, leading to a higher binding amount and larger thickness increase.

The Fe3O4 NPs are grafted with PMMA brushes with molecular weights ranging from 2700 to 35 700 g/mol. For the NP with the lowest molecular weight brush, the morphology of the nanocomposite ﬁlm depends on the NP concentration (φNP). At low φNP, the block copolymer self-assembles into mixed morphology of perpendicular lamellae (perpendicular Lam) and parallel lamellae (|Lam), and the ⊥Lam are stabilized by individual NPs or small NP aggregates. The NPs can also retard the dynamics of self-assembly of block copolymer ﬁlms. At high φNP, NPs form small aggregates which inhibit the formation of a lamellar structure. As the molecular weight of the PMMA brush increases to 13 300 or 35 700 g/mol, the Fe3O4 NPs form aggregates in the as-cast nanocomposite ﬁlms, and this behavior is attributed to aggregation of NPs in the solution state. Since the size of NP aggregates is larger than the copolymer domain size, the block copolymer has to self-assemble around these aggregates. The magnetic properties of these nanocomposite ﬁlms are characterized, and typical superparamagnetic behavior is observed.",

We then conjecture that these systems show phase mixing or demixing depending on the miscibility between the brush and matrix chains (“autophobic dewetting”). At 15 mass \% particle loading, composites created using the same grafted nanoparticle, but with two different matrices, yield well dispersed nanoparticles or nanoparticle “agglomerates”, respectively. Rheology experiments show that the composites display solid-like behavior only when the particles are aggregated. As deduced in previous work, this difference in behavior is attributed to the presence of percolating particle clusters in the agglomerated samples which allows for stress propagation through the system. Going further, we compare the local mobility of matrix and grafted segments of both composites using quasi-elastic neutron scattering experiments. For the liquid-like system, the mean square displacements of the grafted chains and matrix chains, the particle structuring and mechanical response are all unaffected by annealing time. In contrast, in the reinforced case, only the local matrix motion is unaffected by time. Since the particle clustering and solid-like mechanical reinforcement increase with increasing time, we conclude that mechanical reinforcement in polymer nanocomposites is purely based on the nanoparticles, with essentially no “interference” from the matrix. In conjunction with other results in the literature, we then surmise that mechanical reinforcement is caused by the bridging of particles by the grafted polymer layers and not due to the formation of “glassy” polymer layers on the nanoparticles.",

A successful strategy for designing polymer nanocomposites is polymer functionalization via attaching functional groups with specific affinity for the inorganic component. In this paper, a systematic investigation by molecular dynamics of polymer functionalization for design of composites combining nanosize crystallites with multiblock polymers in solution is presented. It is shown that functionalization is an example of active self-assembly, where the resulting polymer nanocomposite exhibits a different type of order than the original pure polymer system ͑without inorganic components͒. Optimal polymer architectures and concentrations are identified appropriate for different applications, alongside an in-depth analysis on the origin and stability of the resulting phases as well as its experimental implications.",

We have demonstrated that the F127 block copolymer ((PEO)106(PPO)70(PEO)106), “F type”, mesostructured silica film is a suitable “soft” template for the fabrication of spherical silver nanoparticles arrays. Silver spheres grow from 7 to 11 nm upon the second reduction step. As a consequence, a red shift of the surface plasmon resonance associated with metallic silver has been observed and attributed to plasmonic coupling between particles. Using a P123 block copolymer ((PEO)$\_{20}$(PPO)$\_{70}$(PEO)$\_{20}$), “P type”, mesostructured silica film, we have obtained silver nanowires with typical dimension of 10 nm Â 100 nm. The corresponding surface plasmon resonance is blue-shifted. The hydroxylamine chloride treatment appears to be efficient only when a previous chemical reduction is performed, assuming that the first sodium borohydride reduction induces a high concentration of silver nuclei in the first layer of the porous silica (film/air interface), which explains their reactivity for further growth.",

The response of the copolymer morphology to DC electric ﬁelds is probed at temperatures where the bulk copolymer adopts either the gyroid or the cylindrical phase. At 150C electric ﬁeld alignment results in vertical arrays of cylinders, lamellae, and perforated lamellae while at 180 C the gyroid phase coexists with a standing perforated lamellar phase. We show that both polymer–substrate interactions and substrate topography are critical factors determining substrate reconstruction of the gyroid phase. Spontaneous cross-ﬁlm percolation of the minority network phase on a given substrate, a prerequisite for electrochemical replication, is dependent on surface topology at the scale of the gyroid unit cell. Importantly, under suitable processing conditions all these complex copolymer morphologies can be electrochemically replicated to produce highly ordered freestanding nanostructured arrays over large areas.",

The calculations demonstrated that the dispersion energy is a leading component in π-stacked oligomers of all sizes. Exchange-repulsion energy also plays an important role. The contribution of polarization is small in these systems, whereas the magnitude of electrostatics varies.

For spherical nanoparticles dispersed in a polymer matrix the results indicate that the chain motion exhibits three distinct regions of diffusion, the Rouse-like motion, an intermediate subdiffusive regime followed by a normal Fickian diffusion. The motion of the chain end monomers shows a scaling that can be attributed to the formation of strong “networklike” structures, which have been seen in a variety of polymer nanocomposite systems. Irrespective of the polymer-particle interaction strengths, these three regimes seem to be present with small deviations. Further investigation on dynamic structure factor shows that the deviations simply exist due to the presence of strong enthalpic interactions between the monomers with the nanoparticles, albeit preserving the anomaly in the chain diffusion. The time-temperature superposition principle is also tested for this system and shows a striking resemblance with systems near glass transition and biological systems with molecular crowding. The universality class of the problem can be enormously important in understanding materials with strong afﬁnity to form either a glass, a gel or networklike structures.",

	abstract = "Symmetry-adapted perturbation theory SAPT offers insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions. In addition, accurate energies can be obtained from the wave function-based variant of SAPT provided that intramonomer electron correlation effects are included. We apply density-ﬁtting DF approximations to the intramonomer correlation corrections in SAPT. The introduction of this approximation leads to an improvement in the computational cost of SAPT by reducing the scaling of certain SAPT terms, reducing the amount of disk I/O, and avoiding the explicit computation of certain types of MO integrals. We have implemented all the intramonomer correlation corrections to SAPT through second-order under the DF approximation. Additionally, leading third-order terms are also implemented. The accuracy of this truncation of SAPT is tested against the S22 test set of Hobza and co-workers Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 8, 1985 2006 . When the intramonomer corrections to dispersion are included in SAPT, a mean absolute deviation of 0.3– 0.4 kcal mol−1 is observed for the S22 test set when using an aug-cc-pVDZ basis. The computations on the adenine-thymine complexes in the S22 test set with an aug-cc-pVDZ basis represent the largest SAPT computations to date that include this degree of intramonomer correlation. Computations of this size can now be performed routinely with our newly developed DF-SAPT program.",

In this work, we apply DF and a related approach, Cholesky decomposition (CD) , to wave function-based symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT). We also test the one-center approximation to the Cholesky decomposition. The DF and CD approximations lead to a dramatic improvement in the overall computational cost of SAPT, while introducing negligible errors. For typical target accuracies, the Cholesky basis needed is noticeably smaller than the DF basis although the cost of constructing the Cholesky vectors is slightly greater than that of constructing the three-index DF integrals . The SAPT program developed in this work is applied to the interactions between acenes previously studied by Grimme Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 47, 3430 2008 , expanding the cases studied by adding the pentacene dimer. The SAPT decomposition of the acene interactions provides a more realistic picture of the interactions than that from the energy decomposition analysis previously reported. The data suggest that parallel-displaced and T-shaped acene dimers both feature a special stabilizing - interaction arising from electron correlation terms which are signiﬁcantly more stabilizing than expected on the basis of pairwise −C6R−6 estimates. These terms are qualitatively the same in T-shaped as in parallel-displaced geometries, although they are roughly a factor of 2 smaller in T-shaped geometries because of the larger distances between the intermolecular pairs of electrons.",

Here, we report the ﬁrst demonstration of metal nanodot memory using a self-assembled block copolymer lift-off. This metal nanodot memory with simple low temperature processes produced an ultrawide memory window of 15 V at the (18 V voltage sweep. Such a large window can be adopted for multilevel cell operations. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy studies showed a periodic metal nanodot array with uniform distribution deﬁned by the block copolymer pattern. Consequently, this metal nanodot memory has high potential to reduce the variability issues that metal nanocrystal memories previously had and multilevel cells with ultrawide memory windows can be fabricated with high reliability and manufacturability.",

However, it is difficult to imagine how nucleic acid polymers first appeared, as the abiotic chemical formation of long nucleic acid polymers from mononucleotides or short oligonucleotides remains elusive, and barriers to achieving this goal are substantial. One specific obstacle to abiotic nucleic acid polymerization is strand cyclization. Chemically activated short oligonucleotides cyclize efficiently, which severely impairs polymer growth. We show that intercalation, which stabilizes and rigidifies nucleic acid duplexes, almost totally eliminates strand cyclization, allowing for chemical ligation of tetranucleotides into duplex polymers of up to 100 base pairs in length. In contrast, when these reactions are performed in the absence of intercalators, almost exclusively cyclic tetra- and octa-nucleotides are produced. Intercalator-free polymerization is not observed, even at tetranucleotide concentrations >10; 000-fold greater than those at which intercalators enable polymerization. We also demonstrate that intercalation-mediated polymerization is most favored if the size of the intercalator matches that of the base pair; intercalators that bind to Watson–Crick base pairs promote the polymerization of oligonucleotides that form these base pairs. Additionally, we demonstrate that intercalation-mediated polymerization is possible with an alternative, non-Watson–Crick-paired duplex that selectively binds a complementary intercalator. These results support the hypothesis that intercalators (acting as ‘molecular midwives’) could have facilitated the polymerization of the first nucleic acids and possibly helped select the first base pairs, even if only trace amounts of suitable oligomers were available.",

Each FMO calculation was carried out at the MP2 level of theory with the cc-pVDZ in which the resolution of the identity approximation was employed to reduce the computational cost. The solvent interaction energies obtained from the calculations provided information about the hydrophilicity of the three R-helices. We examined the roles of the charged residues in retaining the native structure of PrP with the calculated intramolecular interaction energies. The analysis, focused on van der Waals interaction, showed that the hydrophobic residues were important for the stability of the native structure. Our results were also discussed in relation to the identiﬁed pathogenetic mutations of prion diseases. Additionally, we examined the distribution of the calculated values with 40 structures, in which we demonstrated the inﬂuence of geometrical ﬂuctuations on quantum chemical calculations.",

In the first step a potential energy surface was determined for the stacked dimer at the SCS-MP2/aTZ level. The energy of the stacked parallel dimer was scanned with respect to the lateral displacement of the two molecules at various interplane distances, and the minima and saddle points were determined. These results were refined by high level quadratic CI (QCISD(T)/aDZ) calculations. The aTZ and aDZ basis sets employed are derived from the aug-cc-pVDZ and aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets but diffuse functions are placed only at every second carbon atom, alleviating the severe numerical difficulties of the full augmented basis sets while retaining all important contributions. To estimate the QCISD(T) energies for larger basis set, we employed commonly used procedure of adding basis set correction values obtained at the MP2 level. This hybrid scheme was used to obtain the final optimised geometries and binding energies; these are believed to be close approximations to the basis set limit QCISD(T) values. A few calculations were also performed to the T-shaped conformer, although this is less important in the coronene dimer than in the benzene dimer. The high-level results were used as a benchmark to assess the performance of simpler and less expensive ab initio methods for these large rings with small HOMO–LUMO gaps, for instance the SCS-MP2 method, and modern DFT versions that are optimised for dispersion dominated systems.",

Using the zero average contrast method, we can properly match silica signal to directly measure the form factor of a single PS chain. An important effort has been put to eliminate the silica scattering using two distinct approaches (called respectively “three” and “four” components methods) leading to analogue results. By combining SANS data with small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements and transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) images on the same samples, we obtain a very clear result about the effect on polymer chain conformation of the filler dispersion, either at low filler volume fraction, where silica arrange in small aggregates or at higher concentration where it forms a connected network. From SANS the chain conformation in nanocomposites is identical to the one without silica in a large q range illustrating that the chain conformation remains independent of the filler dispersion whatever the silica connectivity or the polymer molecular weight. This result opens the way to a better overview of the polymer chain conformation contribution, especially adsorption or chain mobility modification effects, in the complex mechanical reinforcement mechanisms of nanocomposites. However, at low q, an unexpected shoulder appears in the SANS curves: this effect does not vary in a systematic way neither with chain molecular weight nor with silica concentration.

They possess the remarkable capacity to accelerate reactions by many orders of magnitude compared to their uncatalyzed counterparts, making feasible crucial processes that would otherwise not occur on biologically relevant timescales. Thus, there is broad interest in understanding the catalytic power of enzymes on a molecular level. Several proposals have been put forward to try to explain this phenomenon, and one that has rapidly gained momentum in recent years is the idea that enzyme dynamics somehow contributes to catalysis. This review examines the dynamical proposal in a critical way, considering basically all reasonable definitions, including (but not limited to) such proposed effects as ‘‘coupling between conformational and chemical motions,’’ ‘‘landscape searches’’ and ‘‘entropy funnels.’’ It is shown that none of these proposed effects have been experimentally demonstrated to contribute to catalysis, nor are they supported by consistent theoretical studies. On the other hand, it is clarified that careful simulation studies have excluded most (if not all) dynamical proposals. This review places significant emphasis on clarifying the role of logical definitions of different catalytic proposals, and on the need for a clear formulation in terms of the assumed potential surface and reaction coordinate. Finally, it is pointed out that electrostatic preorganization actually accounts for the observed catalytic effects of enzymes, through the corresponding changes in the activation free energies.",

Some thermodynamic quantities such as free energy, entropy, and enthalpy are also obtained to explain the process of NPs binding. Furthermore, the bending energy of wrapping of NPs against the electrostatic potential energy is also discussed based on the Helfrich theory, indicating that the driving force of the wrap originates from the gain in electrostatic energy at the cost of the elastic energy of biomembranes.

Biophys. J. 2007, 92, L20-22). Identifying the structural causes of differences in reactivity between conformations in such complex systems is not trivial. Here, we show that multivariate analysis of key structural parameters can identify structural determinants of barrier height by analysis of multiple reaction paths.

Geometrical parameters (consisting of the key bond distances that change during the reaction) were collected and used for principal component analysis (PCA), partial least-squares (PLS) regression analysis, and multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis. PCA indicates that different “families” of enzyme-substrate conformations arise from QM/MM molecular dynamics simulation and that rarely sampled, catalytically signiﬁcant conformational states can be identiﬁed. PLS and MLR analyses allowed the construction of linear regression models, correlating the calculated activation barriers with simple geometrical descriptors. These analyses reveal the presence of two fully independent geometrical effects, explaining 78\% of the variation in the activation barrier, which are directly correlated with transition-state stabilization (playing a major role in catalysis) and substrate binding. These results highlight the power of statistical approaches of this type in identifying crucial structural features that contribute to enzyme reactivity.",

	abstract = "We propose a theory for the structure of the interphase in polymeric nanocomposites based on the freely-jointed chain near an impermeable spherical inclusion. The theory considers only the entropic exclusion between a polymer and the inclusion. The radius of gyration of the polymer chain and its distortion from spherical symmetry are perturbed strongly when the chain end is closer than 3Rg0 from the surface of the sphere, where Rg0 is the unperturbed radius of gyration. Also, the maximum expansion of the chain is bounded by (4/3)½, equal to a 15\% increase. The shape of the polymer chain is elongated tangentially to the surface when the chain end originates in the interphase, but elongates radially due to entropic repulsion when the chain end is very close to the surface of the sphere. All the distortions of the polymer conformation from ideality, and hence the spatial extent of the interphase, occur within the depletion region associated with colloids. The model is used to explain recent experimental results showing that polymer chain dimensions increase in the presence of nanoparticles. The model quantitatively reproduces the observations at low ﬁller loadings using no adjustable parameters, suggesting that entropic arguments can describe the majority of the effect there.",

The HF and MP2 levels do not provide reliable values for many-body terms, making it necessary to go beyond the MP2 level. The benchmark CCSD(T) three- and four-body nonadditivities are reasonably well reproduced at the MP3 level, and almost quantitative agreement is obtained (fortuitously) either on the L-CCD level or as an average of the MP3 and the CCSD results. Reliable values of many-body terms (especially their higher-order correlation contributions) are obtained already when the rather small 6-31G**(0.25,0.15) basis set is used. The four-body term is much smaller when compared to the three-body terms, but it is deﬁnitely not negligible, e.g. in the case of the GC step it represents about 16\% of all of the three- and four-body terms.

Geometry optimisation is found to be straightforward with DF-LMP2 without the need for counterpoise correction, resulting in geometries very close to previous, counterpoise-corrected structures. Spin-component scaling of gradients to correct for the known shortcomings of conventional MP2 has only a small effect on geometries in most cases, but significantly alters the distance between aromatic rings in stacked complexes. Harmonic frequency calculation is made possible by efficient use of parallel computing resources, and confirms all structures to be true minima, unlike previous estimates using density functional theory.

In this paper we have conducted a Monte Carlo simulation study on copolymer grafted spherical nanoparticles to show the tremendous potential of using monomer sequence on the copolymers to tune the grafted chain conformation, and thus the effective interactions between copolymer grafted nanoparticles. We have studied AB copolymers with alternating, multiblock, or diblock sequences, where either A monomers or B monomers have monomer-monomer attractive interactions. Our focus has been to show the nontrivial effect of monomer sequence on the conformations of the grafted copolymers at various particle diameters, grafting densities, copolymer chain lengths, and monomer-monomer interactions in an implicit small molecule solvent. We observe that the monomer sequence, particle diameter, and grafting density dictate whether a the grafted chains aggregate to bring attractive monomers from multiple grafted chains together interchain and intrachain monomer aggregation if the enthalpy gained by doing so offsets the entropic loss caused by stretching of chains, or b each grafted chain folds onto itself to bring its attractive monomers together only intrachain monomer aggregation if the entropic loss from interchain aggregation cannot be overcome by the enthalpic gain. For six copolymers of chain length N = 24 grafted on a spherical particle of diameter D = 4, interchain and intrachain monomer aggregation occurs, and the radius of gyration varies nonmonotonically with increasing blockiness of the monomer sequence. At larger particle diameters the grafted chains transition to purely intrachain monomer aggregation. The radius of gyration varies monotonically with monomer sequence for intrachain monomer aggregation because as the sequence becomes blockier like monomers are grouped together , the copolymer chain has to fold less compactly to maximize the enthalpically favorable contacts while maintaining high conformational entropy. The radius of gyration of alternating and diblock copolymers scales with chain length N through a power law Rg2 1/2 = N with the prefactor and scaling exponent, varying with monomer sequence and monomer-monomer attraction strength.",

	abstract = "High level ab initio methods have been used to study stacking interactions in ten unique base pair steps both in A-RNA and in B-DNA duplexes. The protocol for selection of geometries based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is proposed, and its suitability is demonstrated by comparison with stacking in steps at fiber diffraction geometries. It is shown that fiber diffraction geometries are not sufficiently accurate for interaction energy calculations. In addition, the protocol for selection of geometries based on MD simulations allows for the evaluation of the variability of the intrinsic stacking energies along the MD trajectories. The uncertainty in stacking energies (difference between the most and least stable geometry) due to the dynamical nature of systems can be, in some cases, as large as 3.0 kcal center dot mol(-1), which is almost 50\% of the actual sequence dependence of base stacking energies (the energy difference between the most and least stable sequences). Thus, assessing the relative magnitude of the gas phase stacking energy using a single geometry for each sequence is insufficient to obtain an unambiguous order of gas phase stacking energies in canonical double helices. Though the ordering of ten unique dinucleotide steps cannot be definitive, some general conclusions were drawn. The stacking energies of base pair steps in A-RNA are more evenly separated compared to B-DNA, and their ordering is less sensitive to the dynamics of the system compared to be B-DNA. The most stable step both in B-DNA W A-RNA is the CG/CG step that is well separated from the second most stable step GC/GC. Also the leas/stable step (the CC/GG step) is well separated from the rest of the structures. The calculations further show that B-DNA stacking is favorable only marginally (on average by 1.14 kcal center dot mol(-1) per base pair step) over A-RNA stacking, and this difference vanishes after subtracting the stabilizing van der Waals effect of the thymine 5-methyl group that is absent in RNA. Basically, no correlation between the sequence dependence of gas phase stacking energies and the sequence dependence of Delta G degrees(37) free energies used in nearest-neighbor models was found either for B-DNA or for A-RNA. This reflects the complexity of the balance of forces that are responsible for the sequence dependence of thermodynamics stability of nucleic acids, which masks the effect of the intrinsic interactions between the stacked base pairs.",

	abstract = "The S22 test set of interaction energies for small model complexes [Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 8, 1985 2006] has been very valuable for benchmarking new and existing methods for noncovalent interactions. However, the basis sets utilized to compute the CCSD(T) interaction energies for some of the dimers are insufﬁcient to obtain converged results. Here we consistently extrapolate all CCSD(T)/complete basis set (CBS) interaction energies using larger basis sets for the CCSD(T) component of the computation. The revised values, which we designate S22A, represent the most accurate results to date for this set of dimers. The new values appear to be within a few hundredths of 1 kcal mol−1 of the true CCSD(T)/CBS limit at the given geometries, but the former S22 values are off by as much as 0.6 kcal mol−1 compared to the revised values. Because some of the most promising methods for noncovalent interactions are already achieving this level of agreement or better compared to the S22 data, more accurate benchmark values would clearly be helpful. The MP2, SCS-MP2, SCS-CCSD, SCS MI -MP2, and B2PLYP-D methods have been tested against the more accurate benchmark set. The B2PLYP-D method outperforms all other methods tested here, with a mean average deviation of only 0.12 kcal mol−1. However, the consistent, slight underestimation of the interaction energies computed by the SCS-CCSD method an overall mean absolute deviation and mean deviation of 0.24 and −0.23 kcal mol−1, respectively suggests that the SCS-CCSD method has the potential to become even more accurate with a reoptimization of its parameters for noncovalent interactions.",

In general, using a longer tether length or increasing the number of tethered chains without increasing the number of ligands increases the conformational penalty for tether stretching/compression near the cell surface and leads to a decrease in targeting efﬁciency. At the same time, using longer tethers or a larger core size allows ligands to interact with receptors over a larger cell surface area, which can enhance the nanoparticle afﬁnity toward the cell surface. We also discuss the selectivity of nanoparticle targeting of cells with a high receptor density. Based on the obtained results, we provide recommendations for improving the nanoparticle binding afﬁnity and selectivity, which can guide future nanoparticle development for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.",

However, identiﬁcation of polymeric systems for universal fouling control is often impeded by the poor knowledge of interactions between biological substances and polymeric substrates in diverse aqueous environments. In this article, we review predictions of the polymer density functional theory (DFT) on the structural and surface properties of polymer brushes and polymer nanocomposites that are potentially useful for antifouling applications. In comparison to alternative theoretical methods, DFT exhibits versatile features that are ideal for investigating various polymer-mediated interactions, self-organization of nanoparticles, and surface-induced phase transitions. It is capable of explicit description of important microscopic details of polymeric systems including the molecular excluded-volume effects, associating interactions, van der Waals attraction, Coulomb forces, and inter- and intra- molecular correlations. The theoretical descriptions of surface forces may provide helpful guidelines in the design and development of polymeric materials for preventing non-speciﬁc adsorption of biological substances.",

Here we propose an activation mechanis mfor the β2-adrenergic receptor, a prototypical GPCR, based on atomic-level simulations in which an agonist-bound receptor transitions spontaneously fro mthe active to the inactive crystallgoraphically observed conformation. A loosely coupled allosteric network, comprising three regions that cna each switch individually between multiple distinct conformations, links small perturbations at the intracellular G-protein-binding site. Out simulation also exhibit an intermediate that may represent a receptor confomation to which a G protein binds during activation, and suggest that the first structural changes during receptor actvation often take place on the intracellular side of the receptor, far from the drug-binding site. By capturing this fundamental signaling process in atomic detail, our results may provide a foundation for hte design of drugs that control receptor signaling more preceisley by stabilizing specific receptor confromations.",

We captures this pharmaceutically critical process in atomic detail using the first unbiased molecular dynamics simulations in which drug molecules spontaneously associate with G-protein-coupled receptors to achieve final poses metching those determined crystallographically. We found that several beta blockers and a beta agonist all traverse the same well-defined, dominant pathway as they bind to the β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors, intially making contact with a vestibule on each receptor's extracellular surface. Surprisingly, association with this vestibule, at a distnace of 15 Å from the binding pokcet, often present the largets energetic barrier to binding, despite the fact that subsequent entry into the binding pocket requires the receptor to deform and the drug to squeeze through a narrow passage. The early barrier appears to reflect the substantial dehydration that takes place as the drug associates with the vestibule. Our atomic-level description of the binding process suggests opportunities for allosteric modulation and provides a structural foundation for future optimization of drug–receptor binding and unbinding rates.},

Computer simulation approaches require models, which cover these scales. These are typically multiscale models that combine and link different levels of resolution. In order to reach mesoscopic time- and length scales, necessary to access material properties, coarse-grained models are developed. They are based on microscopic, atomistic descriptions of systems and represent these systems on a coarser, mesoscopic level. While the connection between length scales can be established immediately, the link between the different time scales that takes into account the faster dynamics of the coarser system cannot be obtained directly. In this perspective paper we discuss methods that link the time scales in structure based multiscale models. Concepts which try to rigorously map dynamics of related models are limited to simple model systems, while the challenge in soft matter systems is the multitude of fluctuating energy barriers of comparable height. More pragmatic methods to match time scales are applied successfully to quantitatively understand and predict dynamics of one-component soft matter systems. However, there are still open questions. We point out that the link between the dynamics on different resolution levels can be affected by slight changes of the system, as for different tacticities. Furthermore, in two-component systems the dynamics of the host polymer and of additives are accelerated very differently.",

	abstract = {By tuning the polymer-filler interaction, filler size and filler loading, we use a coarse-grained model-based molecular dynamics simulation to study the polymer-filler interfacial structural (the orientations at the bond, segment and chain length scales, chain size and conformation), dynamic and stress-strain properties. Simulated results indicate that the interfacial region is composed of partial segments of different polymer chains, which is consistent with the experimental results presented by Chen et al. {(Macromolecules,} 2010, 43, 1076). Moreover, it is found that the interfacial region is within one single chain size {(Rg)} range, irrespective of the polymer-filler interaction and the filler size, beyond which the bulk behavior appears. In the interfacial region, the orientation and dynamic behaviors are induced by the interfacial enthalpy, while the size and conformation of polymer chains near the filler are controlled by the configurational entropy. In the case of strong polymer-filler interaction (equivalent to the hydrogen bond), the innerest adsorbed polymer segments still undergo adsorption-desorption process, the transport of chain mass center in the interfacial region exhibits away from the glassy behavior, and no plastic-like yielding point appears in the stress-strain curve, which indicates that although the mobility of interfacial polymer chains is restricted, there exist no "polymer glassy layers" surrounding the filler. In addition, it is evidenced that the filler particle prefers selectively adsorbing the long polymer chains for attractive polymer-filler interaction, validating the experimental explanation of the change of the bound rubber {(BR).} In short, this work provides important information for further experimental and simulation studies of polymer-nanoparticle interfacial behavior.},

A hybrid mesoscopic approach to study the dynamics of nanocomposites composed from a block copolymer melt and a suspension of colloids is proposed. A collective description of the polymer dynamics is combined with the individual resolution of the colloids. The implementation of the method in two and three dimensions is described and the method is tested for different particle sizes, diblock copolymer compositions and polymer/colloid interactions.",

Interaction energies for the equilibrium geometry complexes have been recalculated using a triple-ζ basis set for the CCSD(T) term in the CCSD(T)/CBS scheme. This allows for the extrapolation of this term to the complete basis set limit, improving accuracy by almost 1 order of magnitude compared to the scheme previously used for the S66 set. Now, we estimate the largest error in the set to be about 1\%. Validation of several methods against the new data indicates the exceptional robustness and accuracy of the SCS-MI-CCSD method. The second extension improves the coverage of nonequilibrium geometries. We introduce a new data set, S66a8, that samples intermolecular angular degrees of freedom in the S66 complexes. For each of the 66 complexes, eight displaced geometries have been constructed, systematically sampling possible rotations of the monomers. Interaction energies in this set are calculated at the CCSD(T)/CBS level consistently with the earlier introduced S66x8 data set that samples the intermolecular distance.",

Beginning with a summary of advanced statistical-mechanical theories including the renormalization group theory, the book reviews dynamical theories, and covers the kinetics of phase ordering, spinodal decomposition, and nucleation in depth. The phase transition dynamics of real systems are discussed, treating interdisciplinary problems in a unified manner. Topics include supercritical fluid dynamics, stress-diffusion coupling in polymers, and mesoscopic dynamics at structural phase transitions in solids. Theoretical and experimental approaches to shear flow problems in fluids are reviewed. Phase Transition Dynamics provides a comprehensive account, building on the statistical mechanics of phase transitions covered in many introductory textbooks. It will be essential reading for researchers and advanced graduate students in physics, chemistry, metallurgy and polymer science.",

Various supermolecule approaches for the calculation of accurate interaction potentials are discussed. Perturbation theory of intermolecular forces is reviewed in great details. The problem of symmetry-adaptation is explained and a general symmetry-adapted perturbation theory is formulated. Convergence properties of various symmetry-adapted expansions are surveyed, and illustrated on several examples. Physical interpretation of the interaction potential in terms of the four fundamental interaction components: electrostatics, induction, dispersion, and exchange-repulsion is thoroughly exposed. Many-electron formulation of the symmetry-adapted perturbation theory in both the wave function and density functional approaches is introduced. One-center and multicenter multipole expansions neglecting the charge-overlap effects, as well as the bipolar expansion accounting for these effects are discussed. The relation of some supermolecule approaches with the perturbation theory of intermolecular forces is brieﬂy sketched. Approximate models that can be deduced from the rigorous theory of intermolecular forces, and applicable to the interactions of large systems are discussed. Finally, perturbation theory of nonadditive interactions in trimers and of the collision-induced electric properties of binary collisional complexes is also reviewed. The theory part is completed by an exposition of methods needed on the route from intermolecular potentials and collision-induced properties to physically measurable quantities such as the Raman spectra, rovibrational spectra, scattering cross sections, as well as thermodynamic, dielectric, and refractive properties of dilute gases. The present status of symmetry-adapted perturbation theory applied to the calculations of state-of-the-art ab initio potential energy surfaces and collision-induced properties is presented, and illustrated by means of applications to rovibrational spectra of Van der Waals molecules, scattering cross sections and pressure broadening coefﬁcients, collision-induced Raman spectra of atomic gases, solvation processes, and thermodynamic, dielectric, and refractive properties of dilute gases. Theoretical results are compared with high accuracy experimental data.",

We discuss the potential of this method for typical systems and show the results of simulations for a nanoparticle/polymer mixture.",
