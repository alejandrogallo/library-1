In developing femtochemistrysthe study of molecular motions in the ephemeral transition states of physical, chemical, and biological changesswe have harnessed the powerful concept of molecular coherence and developed ultrafast-laser techniques for observing these motions. Femtosecond resolution (1 fs = 10$^{-15}$ s) is the ultimate achievement for studies of the dynamics of the chemical bond at the atomic level. On this time scale, matter wave packets (particle-type) can be created and their coherent evolution as a single-molecule trajectory can be observed. The field began with simple systems of a few atoms and has reached the realm of the very complex in isolated, mesoscopic, and condensed phases and in biological systems such as proteins and DNA. It also offers new possibilities for the control of reactivity and for structural femtochemistry and femtobiology.",

Calculations have been performed for zero total angular momentum using a recent high-accuracy potential-energy surface for the {X2A'} electronic ground state. For {Li+HF(v=0,j=0),} the reaction is dominated by resonances due to the decay of metastable states of the Li {cdots,...F-H} van der Waals complex. Assignment of these resonances has been carried out by calculating the eigenenergies of the quasibound states. We also find that while chemical reactivity is greatly enhanced by vibrational excitation, the resonances get mostly washed out in the reaction of vibrationally excited {HF} with Li atoms. In addition, we find that at low energies, the reaction is significantly suppressed due to the less-efficient tunneling of the relatively heavy fluorine atom.",

The results indicate that, although an associative mechanism of alkaline hydrolysis is followed by all these compounds, P-F and P-CN bonds are cleaved according to the multistep addition-elimination scheme, whereas the breakage of P-O and P-S bonds appears to be consistent with the one-step direct-displacement mechanism. Of the two alternative reaction pathways present in all those cases (except of acephate), the most probable one involves the proton from a nucleophilic hydroxide experiencing an additional stabilization by the phosphoryl oxygen atom.",
