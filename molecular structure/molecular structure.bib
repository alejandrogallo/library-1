	abstract = "The primary concepts of descriptive chemistry, of an atom in a molecule with its own set of properties, and of a chemical bond, yield to precise definitions in terms of quantum mechanics and the observed topological properties of the charge distribution. T h e notion of a molecule as a collection of bonded atoms with a definite structure and shape is one which has meaning in real, Euclidean space. I t should therefore be a consequence of a property of the system which is itself manifest in real space. It is shown that a particular topological property of the charge density, p ( r ) , defines the boundaries between pairs of bonded atoms (it defines an atom) and the network of bonds which link them (it defines structure). T h e definition of the boundary is universal and it defines the boundary of the molecule, as well as of the atoms within it (it defines molecular shape). These definitions apply to both stationary and dynamic systems. Thus the notions of the making and breaking of chemical bonds are also precisely defined. T h e boundary defined in the usual formulations of quantum mechanics is the one a t infinity where the boundary condition on the variation of is satisfied. These approaches are necessarily restricted in their applications to a total, isolated system. One may obtain a formulation of quantum mechanics which does define the physical subspaces of a system and yields a prediction and description of their average properties. The boundaries of these subspaces are found to be identical with the physical boundaries defined by the topological properties of p(r). The observational and theoretical basis for these definitions is presented and illustrated for the diborane molecule. This paper serves as an introduction to a theory of bonding and molecular structure which is entirely determined by the observed properties of the charge density.",

	abstract = "This paper illustrates how the concepts of atoms and bonds may be given definite expression in terms of the topological properties of the charge density, $\rho(r)$, and how, as a consequence of these identifications, one is led to a definition of structure and to a phenomenological analysis of structural stability. This approach finds its natural expression in Rene Thom's general analysis of structural stability as it applies to a system whose behavior is describable in terms of the gradient of some scalar field. Chemical observations are made in real space, and thus chemical behavior is determined by the morphology of a system's charge distribution and its evolution with time. The analysis of the topological properties in $\rho(r)$ via the associated gradient vector field reduced to the identification of the critical points in $\rho(r)$. Two types of critical points assume special roles in the analysis. A (3,-3) critical point, a maximum in the density, is an attractor and is identified with the position of a nucleus in the molecular system under study. The basin of the attractor defines the atom associated with the corresponding nucleus. A (3,-1) critical point defines the interatomic surface separating two neighboring atoms, and the bond path linking their nuclei, the line along which the charge density is maximum with respect to lateral displacements. hence, neighboring atoms are defined to be bonded to one another and the network of bond pahts, for a given nuclear configuration, determines its molecualr graph. Structure is defined as that set of molecular graphs which contain the same number of bond paths, linking the same nuclei. Thus a change in structure necessitates a change in the number and/or arrangement of bond paths. The making and/or breaking of chemical bonds associated with such a change is topologically a discontinuous process, and the associated change in structure is therefore, abrupt: a continuous change in the nuclear coordinates, the parameters which control the behavior of the system, can lead to a discontinuous change in molecules's behavior. A point in control space defining the nuclear configuration for which such discontinuous behavior is observed, is called a catastrphe point. The set of catastrophe points this partitions nuclear configuration space into regions of different structure. The breaking or making of bonds is a catastrophe of the bifurcation type, resulting form the formation of a singularity in $\rho(r)$, whereas the switching of a bond from one nucleus to another is a catastrophe of the conflict type. It is shown that the analytical description of the formation of a three-membered ring structure from all possible neighboring structures is provided by the unfolding of a particular type of catastrophe, the elliptic umbilic.",

	abstract = "The theory of molecular structure determined by the gradient vector field of the charge density $\rho$ identifies the set of atomic interactions present in a molecule. The interactions so defined are characterized in terms of the properties of the Laplacian of the charge density. A scalar field is oncenctrated in those regions of space where its Laplacian is negative and depleted in those where it is positive. An expression derived from the quantum mechanial stress tensor relates the sign of the laplacian of $\rho$ to the relative magnitude of the local contributions of the potential and kinetic energy densities to their virial theorem averages. By obtaining a map of those regions where the Laplacian is negative, the regions where electronic charge is concentrated, one obtains a map of the regions where the potential energy density makes its dominant contributions to the energy of a system. It is demonstrated that atomic interactions fall into two broad general classes, closed-shell and shared interactions, each characterized by a particular set of mechanical properties. Interactions resulting from the sharing of charge density between atoms, covalent and polar bonds, are caused by a contraction of the charge density towards the line of interaction linking the nuclei. The curvatures of $\rho$ perpendicular to the interaction lines are dominant, electornic charge is concentrated in the internuclear region and the Laplacian is negative. These interaction are characterized by the large negative value of the potential energy in the internuclear region. Interactions between closed-shell atoms as found in noble gas repulsive states, in ionic bonds, in hydrogen bonds, and in van der Waals molecules are governed by the contraction of the charge density towards each of the interacting nuclei. Thus one finds the parallel curvature of $\rho$ to be dominant in these interactions, electronic charge is depleted in the interatomic surface and the Laplacian is negative. The mechanics are characterized by the relatively large value of the kinetic energy, particularly the component parllel to the interaction line. In the closed-shell interactions, the regions of dominenatn potential energy contributions are separately localized within the boundaries of each of the interacting atoms or molecules. In the shared interactions, a region of low potneital energy if contiguous over the basins of both of the interacting atoms. The problem of further classifying a given interaction as belonging to a bound of unbound state of a system is also considered, first from teh electrostatic point of view whereing the regions of charge concentration as determined by the Laplacian of $'rho$ are related to the forces acting on the nuclei. This is followed by and linked to a discussion of the energetics of interactions in terms of the regions of dominant potential and kinetic energy contributions to the virial as again determined by the Laplacian of $'rho$. The properties ofthe Laplacian of the electronic charge thus yield a unified view of atomic interactions, one which incorporates the understandings afforded by the Hellmann-Feynman and virial theorems.",

	abstract = "The quantum mechanics of proper open systems yields the physics that governs the local behavior of the electron density, rho(r). The Ehrenfest force F(r) acting on an element of rho(r) and the virial field nu(r) that determine its potential energy are obtained from equations of motion for the electronic momentum and virial operators, respectively. Each is represented by a dressed density, a distribution in real space that results from replacing the property in question for a single electron with a corresponding density that describes its average interaction with all of the remaining particles in the system. All bond paths, lines of maximum density linking neighboring nuclei in a system in stable electrostatic equilibrium, have a common physical origin in terms of F(r) and nu(r), regardless of the nature of the interaction. Each is homeomorphically mirrored by a virial path, a line of maximally negative potential energy density linking the same nuclei. The presence of a bond path and its associated virial path provide a universal indicator of bonding between the atoms so linked. There is no net force acting on an element of rho(r) or on an atom in a molecule in a stationary state, and nu(r) is attractive everywhere. Thus, contrary to what has appeared in the literature, no repulsive forces act on atoms linked by a bond path, nor on their nuclei. All atomic interactions, including those described as nonbonded and responsible for binding in condensed states of matter, result from a local pairing of the densities of opposite spin electrons. This local pairing, which varies throughout space and with the strength of the interaction, should be distinguished from the notion of an electron pair, as embodied in the Lewis model.",

The {Born–Oppenheimer} separation of electronic and nuclear motions lies at the heart of most modern quantum chemical models of molecular structure. While this separation introduces a great computational and practical simplification, it is neither essential to the conceptual formulation of molecular structure nor universally valid. Going beyond the {Born–Oppenheimer} approximation introduces new paradigms, bringing fresh insight into the chemistry of fluxional molecules, proteins, superconductors and macroscopic dielectrics, thus opening up new avenues for exploration. But it requires that our ideas of molecular structure need to evolve beyond simple ball-and-stick-type models.",
