The book presents an interpretation of chemical bonding and molecular geometry using properties of the electron density, coupled with the theory of atoms in molecules. The review serves as the focal point for a dialogue on the use of orbital representations of the wavefunction in the interpretation of chemistry, as opposed to the use of quantum mechanical observables and their governing theorems, an approach enabling the prediction as well as the interpretation of chemical observations. Frenking is adamant in his criticism of the approach based on the density because it “is based on a physically observable property of the molecule” rather than on the mathematical wavefunction, a result of being “too abstract and too elusive” for chemists to grasp.",

But scientometric co-citation analyses indicate that biochemistry seems presently to be more interconnected to other sciences. On the other hand, mathematics is considered by many to permeate all sciences and hence might compete as the choice for centrality. A critical commentary and argument leads to a proposal for an alternative partially ordered hierarchical “framework” map of sciences. This argument is supplemented by a scientometric approach based on university course requirements for different curricula, so as to support our partially ordered map. This alternative “framework” mapping then is seen to indicate a special position for chemistry, as where significant branching begins.",

In effect, this means that a questioner needs to undergo a process of self-transformation leading to a transcendent state of consciousness in which such an ability is awakened. Franklin Wolff has proposed that there is a way of doing so, namely “mathematical yoga,” that is particularly suited for scientists. Such a spiritual practice consists of doing mathematics, while understanding what one is doing and maintaining a self-giving attitude. Although Wolff has attributed his own enlightenment to this mathematical path, it needs further empirical verification. Wolff s notions also suggest that, even without the occurrence of transcendent states of consciousness, abstract thinking could lead to states of consciousness characterized by greater than ordinary meaningfulness.",
