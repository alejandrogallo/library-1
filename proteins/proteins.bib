	abstract = "Prions cause transmissible and genetic neurodegenerative diseases, including scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy of animals and Creutzfeldt-Jakob and Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker diseases of humans. Infectious prion particles are composed largely, if not entirely, of an abnormal isoform of the prion protein, which is encoded by a chromosomal gene. A posttranslational process, as yet unidentified, converts the cellular prion protein into an abnormal isoform. Scrapie incubation times, neuropathology, and prion synthesis in transgenic mice are controlled by the prion protein gene. Point mutations in the prion protein genes of animals and humans are genetically linked to development of neurodegeneration. Transgenic mice expressing mutant prion proteins spontaneously develop neurologic dysfunction and spongiform neuropathology. Understanding prion diseases may advance investigations ofother neurodegenerative disorders and of the processes by which neurons differentiate, function for decades, and then grow senescent.",

	abstract = "Prions are unprecedented infectious pathogens that cause a group of invariably fatal neurodegenerative diseases by an entirely novel mechanism. Prion diseases may present as genetic, infectious, or sporadic disorders, all of which involve modification of the prion protein (PrP). Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), scrapie of sheep, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) of humans are among the most notable prion diseases. Prions are transmissible particles that are devoid of nucleic acid and seem to be composed exclusively of a modified protein (PrPSc). The normal, cellular PrP (PrPC) is converted into PrPSc through a posttranslational process during which it acquires a high beta-sheet content. The species of a particular prion is encoded by the sequence of the chromosomal PrP gene of the mammals in which it last replicated, In contrast to pathogens carrying a nucleic acid genome, prions appear to encipher strain-specific properties in the tertiary structure of PrPSc. Transgenetic studies argue that PrPSc acts as a template upon which PrPC is refolded into a nascent PrPSc molecule through a process facilitated by another protein. Miniprions generated in transgenic mice expressing PrP, in which nearly half of the residues were deleted, exhibit unique biological properties and should facilitate structural studies of PrPSc. While knowledge about prions has profound implications for studies of the structural plasticity of proteins, investigations of prion diseases suggest that new strategies for the prevention and treatment of these disorders may also find application in the more common degenerative diseases.",

	abstract = "The ab initio fragment molecular orbital (FMO) calculations were performed for the cAMP receptor protein (CRP) complexed with a cAMP and DNA duplex to elucidate their sequence-specific binding and the stability of the DNA duplex, as determined by analysis of their inter- and intramolecular interactions. Calculations were performed with the AMBER94 force field and at the HF and MP2 levels with several basis sets. The interfragment interaction energies (IFIEs) were analyzed for interactions of CRP-cAMP with each base pair, DNA duplex with each amino acid residue, and each base pair with each residue. In addition, base-base interactions were analyzed including hydrogen bonding and stacking of DNA. In the interaction between DNA and CRP-cAMP, there was a significant charge transfer (CT) from the DNA to CRP. and this CT interaction played an important role as well as the electrostatic interactions. It is necessary to apply a quantum mechanical approach beyond the “classical” force-field approach to describe the sequence specificity. In the DNA intramolecular interaction, the dispersion interactions dominated the stabilization of the base-pair stacking interactions. Strong, attractive 1,2-stacking interactions and weak, repulsive 1,3-stacking interactions were observed. Comparison of the intramolecular interactions of free and complexed DNA revealed that the base-pairing interactions were stronger, and the stacking interactions were weaker, in the complexed structure. Therefore, the DNA duplex stability appears to change due to both the electrostatic and the CT interactions that take place under conditions of DNA-CRP binding. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Analyzing the IFIE matrix, we detect important fragments for the function of biomolecular systems and quantify the strength of interaction energies based on quantum chemistry, including the effects of charge transfer, electronic polarization and dispersion force. In this study, by analyzing a protein-DNA complex, we report a visual representation of the IFTE matrix, a so-called IFTE map. We comprehensively examine what information the THE map contains concerning structures and stabilities of the protein-DNA complex.",

The inﬂuence due to the geometrical ﬂuctuation was taken into account by performing calculations on forty different conformations. Each FMO calculation was carried out at the MP2 level of theory with the cc-pVDZ in which the resolution of the identity approximation was employed to reduce the computational cost. The solvent interaction energies obtained from the calculations provided information about the hydrophilicity of the three R-helices. We examined the roles of the charged residues in retaining the native structure of PrP with the calculated intramolecular interaction energies. The analysis, focused on van der Waals interaction, showed that the hydrophobic residues were important for the stability of the native structure. Our results were also discussed in relation to the identiﬁed pathogenetic mutations of prion diseases. Additionally, we examined the distribution of the calculated values with 40 structures, in which we demonstrated the inﬂuence of geometrical ﬂuctuations on quantum chemical calculations.",
