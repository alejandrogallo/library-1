Combining self-consistent field and density functional theories, we develop a model that allows us to determine the equilibrium or metastable phases of diblock copolymer/spherical nanoparticle composites, without making a priori assumptions about the structure of the system. Using this model, we illustrate various examples where mixtures of diblocks and nanoparticles self-assemble into mesoscopically ordered phases.

To determine the morphology of the system, we first use an approach that combines a self-consistent-field theory (SCFT) for the diblocks with a density functional theory (DFT) for the particles. Using this SCF/DFT model, we focus on the lamellar phase of AB diblocks and calculate volume fraction profiles for systems containing selective or nonselective nanoparticles. We use the volume fraction profiles from the SCF/DFT and assign typical dielectric constants for the different polymer domains and the particles to characterize the dielectric properties of the composite. A finite difference time domain (FDTD) technique is then used to simulate the propagation of light through this heterogeneous material. The results of this study allow us to determine how the polymer-particle interactions affect the spatial distribution of fillers within the polymer matrix and how this distribution in turn affects the optical properties of the nanocomposite.

We find that in such restricted geometries a polymer-induced depletion attraction drives the particles to these walls. If the particles are chemically distinct from the walls, they will effectively modify the chemical nature of these substrates. This change in chemistry, in turn, affects the polymer-wall interactions and consequently the structure of the film. We illustrate this point by considering mixtures of particles and symmetric diblocks and show that the confining walls can be exploited to promote the self-assembly of the system into particle nanowires that extend throughout the films and are separated by nanoscale stripes of polymer domains. Such films constitute vital components in the fabrication of nanoscale devices. Furthermore, the results point to a novel technique for modifying the chemical nature of coatings and films entirely through self-assembly. Since this technique relies on entropic effects, it constitutes a fairly robust method that can be applied more generally than approaches that rely primarily on chemistry-specific enthalpic effects.",

Above the order-disorder transition (ODT) the attractive potential of the particles for one kind of monomers leads to a lamellar structure around the particles. These density waves interfere with each other when the distance between the particles is changed, leading to separations with alternating attraction and repulsion between the particles. We further derive analytic results for the potential of mean force in the limit of a weak influence of the particles on the system using the random phase approximation for a diblock copolymer melt.

Usually, self-assembly processes are required to direct nanocrystals with sizes from 1 nm up to tens of nanometers onto functional surfaces. Critical for this binding and deposition process is (a) the control of the chemical nature of the surface onto which the NPs are bound, (b) the structure of the surface of the nanoparticles, in particular the chemical moieties bound, and (c) the tuning of the supramolecular interaction acting between the NP surface and the polymeric surface in terms of binding strength, binding multiplicity, and binding kinetics. In the past, several NP/surface systems relying on self-assembled monolayers (SAM’s) have been reported.",

This article highlights recent research efforts in the field of structure formation in block copolymer-based nanocomposite materials, and points out opportunities for novel materials based on inclusion of different types of nanoparticles. The use of block copolymers instead of homopolymers as the matrix is shown to afford opportunities for controlling the spatial and orientational distribution of the nanoelements.

Previous efforts have concentrated on using such scaffolds to spatially arrange nanoscopic elements as a strategy for tailoring the electrical, magnetic or photonic properties of the material. Recent theoretical arguments have suggested that synergistic interactions between self-organizing particles and a self-assembling matrix material can lead to hierarchically ordered structures. Here we show that mixtures of diblock copolymers and either cadmium selenide- or ferritin-based nanoparticles exhibit cooperative, coupled self-assembly on the nanoscale. In thin ﬁlms, the copolymers assemble into cylindrical domains, which dictate the spatial distribution of the nanoparticles; segregation of the particles to the interfaces mediates interfacial interactions and orients the copolymer domains normal to the surface, even when one of the blocks is strongly attracted to the substrate. Organization of both the polymeric and particulate entities is thus achieved without the use of external ﬁelds, opening a simple and general route for fabrication of nanostructured materials with hierarchical order.",

We assume the size of the nanoparticles to be much smaller than that of the attached polymer chains and therefore model the particles with their grafted polymer “shell” as star polymers. The polymer chains attached to the particles are of the same species as one of the blocks of the symmetric diblock copolymer. Of primary interest is how to tune the shell of the particle by changing both the length and number of tethered polymers in order to achieve higher loading of nanoparticles within an ordered structure without macrophase separation occurring. We ﬁnd that the phase behavior of the system is very sensitive to the size of the particle including its tethered shell. The region of microphase separation is increased upon decreasing the star polymer size, which may be achieved by shortening and/or removing tethered polymer chains. To explore the possible structures in these systems we employ SCFT simulations that provide insight into the arrangement of the different species in these complex composites.",

The resulting phase diagrams are presented for composites containing nanoparticles of various sizes and interaction strengths and include lamellae, perforated lamellae, cylinders, and disordered phases. Composites containing large nanoparticles also exhibit two-phase coexistence between different copolymer phases or between a copolymer phase and a nanoparticle phase, depending on the nanoparticle interaction strength. We also present concentration profiles perpendicular to the lamellar interface for nanoparticles of different sizes and interaction strengths. Neutral nanoparticles concentrate at the interface between copolymer domains, while interacting nanoparticles concentrate within the favorable domain. The larger nanoparticles are more easily localized but have less impact on the copolymer concentration profiles. The lamellar spacing increases with nanoparticle volume fraction for interacting nanoparticles but decreases with nanoparticle size. The locations of the phase transitions are in qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions, but the concentration profiles are inconsistent with theoretical predictions.

At small tilt angles (chevron grain boundary) the particle distribution is equal to the equilibrium distribution (here: center location of PS-coated gold particles within the PS domains of a PS-PEP block copolymer) whereas at larger tilt angles (omega or T-junction grain boundary structure) the particles are found to selectively swell the high elastic energy regions along the grain boundary, thereby stabilizing the formation of otherwise energetically unfavorable grain boundary structures presumably through the relaxation of chains in the grain boundary region. The direct visualization of the swelling process provides the first experimental evidence for the mechanism of stabilization of energetically unfavorable grain boundary structures by selective swelling and stress relief that was previously postulated for block copolymer/homopolymer blends and presents a model system for comparison with theoretical predictions.",

But it can also depend on the kinetics of self-assembly in the polymer, and there are circumstances under which the kinetics of morphologically selective domain nucleation and growth determine the overall nanostructure of the composite. To study the mechanism of morphological seeding in block-copolymer nanocomposites, we have combined cylinder phases of polystyrene-block-polyisoprene diblock (as a solution in dibutylphthalate) and poly(styrene-block-isoprene-block-styrene) triblock (as a blend with homopolystyrene) copolymers with gold nanorods of different diameters and surface treatments. Polarized optical microscopy and transmission electron microscopy on these composites demonstrate that the nanorods selectively nucleate coaxial domains of copolymer cylinders (i.e., domains of cylinders aligned along the same axis as the nanorod). These single nucleation events occur regardless of nanorod diameter and surface character, and determine the order of most of the surrounding polymer. Mesoscale modeling of the nucleation process, performed with nanorods of different diameters and with different polymeresurface interactions, illustrates the mechanism by which copolymer-dispersed nanorods with different sizes and surface chemistry can template the organization of cylindrical copolymer domains.",

In the so-called wet brush limit, when the graft molecualr weight equals or exceeds the matrix value, the silica particles form a uniform random dispersion in poly(styrene). Increasing the hompolymer matrix molecular weight above the graft value results in particle clustering and macroscopic-phase separation. Mixtures of the lamellar formaing block copolymer and nanoparticles exhibit a very different trend, with particle clustering at the lower PS-PB molecular weights and dispersion at the highest value. This latter finding is rationalized on the basis of packing constraints associated with lamnellar order and the effective particle dimensions, and the degree of solvation at ordering, both of which favor higher molecualr weight block copolymers.",

The cylindrical domains of acid-sensitive, self-assembled monolayers of polystyrene poly(2-vinylpyridine) block copolymers on silicon surfaces were utilized as structural elements for the production of parallel metal nanowires. Metal ion loading of the P2VP block with simple aqueous solutions of anionic metal complexes is accomplished via protonation of this basic block, rendering it cationic; electrostatic attraction leads to a high local concentration of metal complexes within the protonated P2VP domain. A subsequent brief plasma treatment simultaneously removes the polymer and produces metallic nanowires. The morphology of the patterns can modulated by controlling solution concentration, deposition time, and molecular weight of the block copolymers, as well as other factors. Horizontal metallic nanoarrays can be aligned on e-beam lithographically deﬁned silicon substrates within different shapes, via graphoepitaxy. This method is highly versatile as the procedures to manipulate nanowire composition, dimension, spacing, and orientation are straightforward and based upon efﬁcient aqueous inorganic chemistry.",

The DFT predicts periodic spacing of lamellar structures in good agreement with molecular dynamics simulations. With the polymer structure from DFT as the input, the PDT is used to examine the effects of particle size, surface energy, polymer chain length, and compressibility on the distribution of nanoparticles in the limit of low particle density.

For the short NRs, the phase behavior is similar to that of spherical nanoparticles (NPs). For the long NRs, the self-assembly of NRs can inﬂuence both the orientation and morphology of diblock/nanorod mixtures.

Toward a quantitative description of the composite structure and associated thermo-mechanical properties from a molecular perspective, we examined the performance of a nonlocal density functional theory that accounts for the excluded-volume effects and intra- and inter-chain correlations self-consistently. It is predicted that, within the lamellar structures of symmetric block copolymers, neutral particles are localized at the microdomain interface, leading to a reduction of the lamellar thickness. Conversely, particles that are energetically biased to a particular microdomain expand the block copolymer lamellar structure. The dilation or shrinkage of the lamellar thickness also depends on the particle packing density. Both particle dispersion and particle-polymer interfacial structure are highly sensitive to the ratio of the particle diameter to the lamellar thickness. While small nanoparticles may either increase or reduce the extensional moduli of the composite material depending on the nanoparticle volume fraction and polymer-particle interactions, large particles always enhance the mechanical properties regardless of the polymer-particle interactions. The theoretical predictions are found to be in qualitative agreement with simulation results and experiments.",

The aim of our present study is to understand how the dispersion of NPs in a block copolymer system is inﬂuenced by elongational ﬂow and how the presence of NPs changes the rheology and ﬂow-induced morphology transition in block copolymers. We consider two different kinds of spherical NPs categorized with respect to their interaction potential with the polymeric blocks: 1 selective NPs that show a preference toward one of the blocks of a model diblock copolymer and 2 nonselective NPs that show equal attraction toward both blocks. For unrestricted simulation times during elongational ﬂow, spatially and temporally periodic boundary conditions devised by Kraynik and Reinelt Int. J. Multiphase Flow 18, 1045 1992 have been implemented. Our results show that the concentration peak of both selective NPs at the center of the preferred domain and nonselective NPs at the domain interface becomes broader with increasing elongation rate, suggesting that elongational ﬂow can be used as another parameter to control nanocomposite self-assembly. In addition, our results reveal that the onset of ﬂow-induced transition from lamellar to disordered morphology is greatly inﬂuenced by particle-particle and particle-polymer interactions.",

Our approach of varying the areal chain density (Σ) of short thiol terminated polystyrene (PS-SH) brushes on the particles where the molecular weight (Mn) of the PS ligands (2.5 kg/mol) is used to control the fraction of the particles adsorbed to the interface of PS-b-P2VP diblock copolymer domains (Mn = 196 kg/mol). The change in Σ from 2.38 to 0.49 chains/nm2 brings systematic control over the fraction of Au particles bound to the PS/P2VP interface ( fi), this fraction ranging from 0 to 95\%. Particles with Σ of 2.38 chains/nm2 ( fi ∼ 0) were observed to localize within the PS domains and further produce a macroscopic particle aggregated phase separate from the PS-b-P2VP mesophase. In contrast, decreasing the Σ of PS chains provides for strong binding of Au nanoparticles to the PS/P2VP interfaces as a consequence of preferential wetting of one block of the copolymer (P2VP) to the Au substrate. Interestingly, the addition of low volume fractions (φP) of such nanoparticle surfactants (Σ < 1.1 chains/nm2) to lamellar diblock copolymers initially leads to a decrease in lamellar thickness, a consequence of decreasing interfacial tension, up to a critical value of φP beyond which the block copolymer adopts a bicontinuous morphology. The relationship between domain spacing and morphology of block copolymer with the level of nanoparticle surfactants will be discussed based on a strong-segregation model. In addition, the rational design of nanoparticle surfactants based on the nature and density of the grafted chains will be described.",

For particles with approximately constant effective size (defined here as the ratio of filler particle diameter to host polymer radius of gyration), miscibility was observed only within diblock copolymers and within the domains formed by the end blocks of triblock copolymers. The limitation of particle miscibility within the triblock mid-domain is interpreted as a consequence of the entropy loss associated with particle deposition due to the stretched configuration of bridged midblock chains. Particle aggregation was observed in both star copolymer samples irrespective of the architecture of the particle-loaded polymer domain. In the case of particle loading of the branched copolymer domain, this is rationalized as a consequence of the increased effective particle size, whereas the incompatibility of particle fillers in the linear block domain of miktoarm copolymer hosts is interpreted as a result of the coupling of dimensional changes within the microstructure along with the reduced axial compressibility of the particle-free branched domain. The sensitive dependence of the particle compatibility on the chain architecture of the polymer host illustrates a yet unexplored parameter space that will need to be taken into account if particle blends are to be designed with branched or multiblock host copolymer architectures.",

The Fe3O4 NPs are grafted with PMMA brushes with molecular weights ranging from 2700 to 35 700 g/mol. For the NP with the lowest molecular weight brush, the morphology of the nanocomposite ﬁlm depends on the NP concentration (φNP). At low φNP, the block copolymer self-assembles into mixed morphology of perpendicular lamellae (perpendicular Lam) and parallel lamellae (|Lam), and the ⊥Lam are stabilized by individual NPs or small NP aggregates. The NPs can also retard the dynamics of self-assembly of block copolymer ﬁlms. At high φNP, NPs form small aggregates which inhibit the formation of a lamellar structure. As the molecular weight of the PMMA brush increases to 13 300 or 35 700 g/mol, the Fe3O4 NPs form aggregates in the as-cast nanocomposite ﬁlms, and this behavior is attributed to aggregation of NPs in the solution state. Since the size of NP aggregates is larger than the copolymer domain size, the block copolymer has to self-assemble around these aggregates. The magnetic properties of these nanocomposite ﬁlms are characterized, and typical superparamagnetic behavior is observed.",

By varying the block ratio, the size of the pore, and the particle concentration, rich phase structures are discovered. It is shown that the structural frustration, the loss of conformational entropy of the polymer chains under conﬁnement, the curvature of the pore, and the steric packing effect of the particles play important roles in determining the morphologies of the nanocomposites under circular conﬁnement. It is found that the increase in the particle concentration can promote the transformation of concentric lamellas to the cylindrical domains. Our results suggest effective ways to stabilize the phase orderings of diblock copolymer-nanoparticle mixtures under two-dimensional circular conﬁnement.",

Organization of nanoparticles into one-, two- and three-dimensional arrays with controlled inter-particle separation and ordering is achieved without chemical modiﬁcation of either the nanoparticles or block copolymers. Nanocomposites responsive to heat and light are demonstrated, where the spatial distribution of the nanoparticles can be varied by exposure to heat or light or changing the local environment.

We have demonstrated that the F127 block copolymer ((PEO)106(PPO)70(PEO)106), “F type”, mesostructured silica film is a suitable “soft” template for the fabrication of spherical silver nanoparticles arrays. Silver spheres grow from 7 to 11 nm upon the second reduction step. As a consequence, a red shift of the surface plasmon resonance associated with metallic silver has been observed and attributed to plasmonic coupling between particles. Using a P123 block copolymer ((PEO)$\_{20}$(PPO)$\_{70}$(PEO)$\_{20}$), “P type”, mesostructured silica film, we have obtained silver nanowires with typical dimension of 10 nm Â 100 nm. The corresponding surface plasmon resonance is blue-shifted. The hydroxylamine chloride treatment appears to be efficient only when a previous chemical reduction is performed, assuming that the first sodium borohydride reduction induces a high concentration of silver nuclei in the first layer of the porous silica (film/air interface), which explains their reactivity for further growth.",

The method is particularly suited for the efficient computational modelling of complex systems with a large variety of constituents. We discuss the potential of this method for typical systems and show the results of simulations for a nanoparticle/polymer mixture.",
