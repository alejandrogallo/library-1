The natural bond orbital (NBO) approach of Weinhold and co-workers is employed to construct intermediate supermolecule and fragment wave functions that satisfy the Pauli exclusion principle, thereby avoiding the principal deficiency of the popular Kitaura-Morokuma energy decomposition scheme. The function counterpoise method of Boys and Bernardi enters the procedure naturally, providing an estimate of basis set superposition error (BSSE) . We lind that the energy components exhibit little basis set dependence when BSSE is small. Applications are presented for several representative molecular and ion complexes: the weak hydrogen bond of the water dimer, the strong ionic interaction of the alkali metal hydrides, and the moderate donor-acceptor interactions of BH3NH3 and BH,C!O. Electrostatic interaction dominates the long-range region of the potential energy surface and charge transfer is strongly stabilizing for fragments within van der Waals contact. The repulsive interaction in the short range region of the potential arises from deformation as the fragment wave functions distort to avoid significant interpenetration.",

The supermolecular energies derived within unrestricted Møller–Plesset perturbation theory are analyzed in terms of perturbation theory of intermolecular forces. The latter has been generalized to allow for the description of monomer wave functions within the unrestricted Hartree–Fock approach. The method is applied to the potential energy surfaces for the ﬁrst excited triplet states, $^3A'$ and $^3A''$ , of the He+Cl$\_2$(3$\Pi\_u$) complex. The $^3A'$ and $^3A''$ potential energy surfaces have different shapes. The lower one, $^3A'$ , has a single minimum for the T-shaped structure. The higher one, $^3A''$ , has the global minimum for the T-shaped structure and the secondary minimum for a linear orientation. The calculated well depth for the $^3A'$ state is 31.1 cm$^{-1}$ at the 3.75 Å intersystem separation at the UMP2 level with extended basis set involving bond functions. The $^3A''$ well depth is approximately 2.3 cm$^{-1}$ smaller at this level. This order is reversed by higher correlation effects. The angular and radial behaviors of the individual components of the $^3A'$ and $^3A''$ interaction energies are compared to reveal the different nature of interaction energies in both states. A comparison with the ground state reveals that the $A''$ state has a typical van der Waals character similar to that of the ground state. The $A'$ state, on the other hand, differs considerably from the ground state. The $A'$ and $A''$ states differ primarily in different role of the intramonomer correlation effects.",

The set of complexes allows us to draw conclusions about the role of the intermolecular charge density in binding. We find that the values of the charge density and its principal axes of curvature at intermolecular critical points in these systems are an order of magnitude less than those found in hydrogen-bonded systems and that the (3,-1) critical points display the hallmarks of closed-shell interactions. The strong correlation between the value of rho at a bond critical point and the binding energy of the complex that has been found previously for hydrogen-bonded systems is harder to expose with the van der Waals molecules presented here. For example, comparison must be restricted to structures in which the same pairs of atoms are interacting. We find that conflict structures may be associated with both equilibrium and transition state conformations but that significant nonrigidity is usually a consequence.

Performance of the proposed correction scheme has been analyzed at the second-order level using a sequence of geminal bases varying in the degree of completeness in representing the intra- and intermonomer correlation effects. The nonlinear parameters of these bases were optimized by minimizing the second-order energy of the helium atom and the second-order dispersion energy of the He dimer.

These applications greatly benefited from the partitioning of interaction energy into its fundamental components, such as electrostatic, exchange, induction, and dispersion. The analyses of a large number of model complexes helped to identify the origins of binding and the sources of anisotropy of these interactions. A detailed examination of the interaction energy components and their computational requirements shed new light on the question of how to saturate the basis-set and the correlation effects. Progress in computational capabilities enabled the use of sufficiently large basis sets and highly correlated methods. With the background of these advances, the ab initio theory of intermolecular interactions entered a new quantitative phase.

Such an assumption is a reflection of a trivial observation that if monomer degrees of freedom are considered, the dimensionality of an intermolecular potential increases dramatically even for few-atom monomers. This puts strict limits on the sizes of clusters with flexible monomers that can be treated by ab initio methods since the number of grid points needed to fit a potential surface quickly becomes enormous. Most of the literature flexible-monomer potentials were obtained from the so-called site-site rigid-monomer potentials by simply allowing the sites to move with atomic nuclei as the monomers are deformed. This simple atom-following approach has been investigated in the present work, using water dimer and Ar-HF as test systems, and shown to be not adequate. A method has been proposed which uses properties of isolated flexible monomers to improve upon the atom-following approach without performing any dimer calculations outside the rigid-monomer grid. The method is shown to give for Ar-HF a 3D representation of the dispersion energy that should be adequate for HF motion in the ground and first excited vibrational states.",

	abstract = "This is the first reported use of a hybrid method involving density functional theory {(DFT)} and symmetry-adapted perturbation theory {(SAPT)} to calculate intermolecular interactions. This work was stimulated by the reported failures of supermolecular {DFT} calculations to adequately predict intermolecular (and interatomic) interactions, particularly of the van der Waals type. The goals are to develop a hybrid scheme that will calculate intermolecular interaction energies accurately and in a computationally efficient fashion, while including the benefits of the energy decomposition provided by {SAPT.} The computational savings result from replacing the costly perturbation theory treatment with {DFT,} which should include the intramolecular correlation effects on the intermolecular interaction energies. The accuracy of this new hybrid approach (labeled {SAPT(DFT))} is evaluated by comparisons with higher level calculations. The test cases include He2, Ar2, {ArH2,} {(H2O)2,} {(HF)2,} {CO2CH3CN,} and {CO2-dimethylnitramine.} The new approach shows mixed results concerning the accuracy of interaction energies. {SAPT(DFT)} correctly predicts all the qualitative trends in binding energies for all test cases. This is particularly encouraging in dimer systems dominated by dispersive interactions where supermolecular {DFT} fails to predict binding. In addition, the method achieves a drastic reduction (a factor of at least 100) in computational time over the higher level calculations often used to predict these forces. With respect to quantitative accuracy, this initial hybrid scheme, using the very popular exchange-correlation functional {B3LYP,} overestimates the second-order energy components (e.g., induction and dispersion terms) for all of the test cases, and subsequently overestimates the total interaction energy for all dimer systems except those heavily dominated by the electrotstatic interactions. The {SAPT} energy decomposition points to the use of {DFT} virtual orbital eigenvalues in the second-order perturbation terms as the likely cause for this error. These results are consistent with earlier work suggesting that {DFT} canonical virtual orbital energies obtained from commonly used functionals are less than optimal for use in such a perturbative scheme. The first-order interaction energy terms from the {SAPT(DFT)} are found to be generally more accurate than the second-order terms, and agree well with the benchmark values for dimers containing molecules with a permanent electric dipole moment. These first-order terms depend only upon the occupied {MO} eigenvectors, and hence are not affected by the inaccuracies in the {KohnSham} {DFT} virtual orbital eigenvalues. These observations encourage future studies utilizing newly reported functionals, some of which have been developed to directly address problems with {DFT} virtual orbital energies and the asymptotic region of the electron density.",

This approach, termed DF-DFT-SAPT, scales with the ﬁfth power of the molecular size and with the third power upon increase of the basis set size for a given dimer, thus drastically reducing the cost of the conventional DFT-SAPT method. The accuracy of the density ﬁtting approximation has been tested for the ethyne dimer. It has been found that the errors in the interaction energies due to density ﬁtting are below 10 3 kcal/mol with suitable auxiliary basis sets and thus one or two orders of magnitude smaller than the errors due to the use of a limited atomic orbital basis set. An investigation of three prominent structures of the benzene dimer, namely, the T shaped, parallel displaced, and sandwich geometries, employing basis sets of up to augmented quadruple- quality shows that DF-DFT-SAPT outperforms second-order Møller-Plesset theory MP2 and gives total interaction energies which are close to the best estimates infered from combining the results of MP2 and coupled-cluster theory with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations.",

This method is conceptually similar to existing {EDA} methods such as Morokuma analysis but includes several important new features. The first is a fully self-consistent treatment of the energy lowering due to polarization, which is evaluated by a self-consistent field calculation in which the molecular orbital coefficients are constrained to be block-diagonal (absolutely localized) in the interacting molecules to prohibit charge transfer. The second new feature is the ability to separate forward and back-donation in the charge-transfer energy term using a perturbative approximation starting from the optimized block-diagonal reference. The newly proposed {EDA} method is used to understand the fundamental aspects of intermolecular interactions such as the degree of covalency in the hydrogen bonding in water and the contributions of forward and back-donation in synergic bonding in metal complexes. Additionally, it is demonstrated that this method can be used to identify the factors controlling the interaction of the molecular hydrogen with open metal centers in potential hydrogen storage materials and the interaction of methane with rhenium complexes.",

Preliminary results for the rare gas dimers He2, Ne2, and Ar2 and a few structures of the (HF)2 and (H2O)2 dimers show that the conventional MP2 interaction energies are considerably improved by this procedure if compared to coupled cluster singles doubles with perturbative triples [CCSD(T)] interaction energies. However, the quality of the interaction energies obtained in this way strongly depends on the exchange-correlation potential employed in the monomer calculations: It is shown that an exact exchange-only potential surprisingly often performs better than an asymptotically corrected hybrid exchange-correlation potential. Therefore the method proposed in this work is similar to the method by Cybulski and Lytle [J. Chem.

The formation and function of supramolecular complexes occur through a multiplicity of often difficult to differentiate noncovalent forces. The aim of this Review is to describe the crucial interaction mechanisms in context, and thus classify the entire subject. In most cases, organic host-guest complexes have been selected as examples, but biologically relevant problems are also considered. An understanding and quantification of intermolecular interactions is of importance both for the rational planning of new supramolecular systems, including intelligent materials, as well as for developing new biologically active agents.",

In addition, accurate energies can be obtained from the wave function-based variant of SAPT provided that intramonomer electron correlation effects are included. We apply density-ﬁtting DF approximations to the intramonomer correlation corrections in SAPT. The introduction of this approximation leads to an improvement in the computational cost of SAPT by reducing the scaling of certain SAPT terms, reducing the amount of disk I/O, and avoiding the explicit computation of certain types of MO integrals. We have implemented all the intramonomer correlation corrections to SAPT through second-order under the DF approximation. Additionally, leading third-order terms are also implemented. The accuracy of this truncation of SAPT is tested against the S22 test set of Hobza and co-workers Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 8, 1985 2006 . When the intramonomer corrections to dispersion are included in SAPT, a mean absolute deviation of 0.3– 0.4 kcal mol−1 is observed for the S22 test set when using an aug-cc-pVDZ basis. The computations on the adenine-thymine complexes in the S22 test set with an aug-cc-pVDZ basis represent the largest SAPT computations to date that include this degree of intramonomer correlation. Computations of this size can now be performed routinely with our newly developed DF-SAPT program.",

In this work, we apply DF and a related approach, Cholesky decomposition (CD) , to wave function-based symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT). We also test the one-center approximation to the Cholesky decomposition. The DF and CD approximations lead to a dramatic improvement in the overall computational cost of SAPT, while introducing negligible errors. For typical target accuracies, the Cholesky basis needed is noticeably smaller than the DF basis although the cost of constructing the Cholesky vectors is slightly greater than that of constructing the three-index DF integrals . The SAPT program developed in this work is applied to the interactions between acenes previously studied by Grimme Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 47, 3430 2008 , expanding the cases studied by adding the pentacene dimer. The SAPT decomposition of the acene interactions provides a more realistic picture of the interactions than that from the energy decomposition analysis previously reported. The data suggest that parallel-displaced and T-shaped acene dimers both feature a special stabilizing - interaction arising from electron correlation terms which are signiﬁcantly more stabilizing than expected on the basis of pairwise −C6R−6 estimates. These terms are qualitatively the same in T-shaped as in parallel-displaced geometries, although they are roughly a factor of 2 smaller in T-shaped geometries because of the larger distances between the intermolecular pairs of electrons.",

Partitioning of interaction energy in the local correlation approach, based on the classes of occupied and virtual orbital involved in the interaction, clearly distinguishes the three types of interaction present in the set of complexes, in agreement with previous classifications. Geometry optimisation is found to be straightforward with DF-LMP2 without the need for counterpoise correction, resulting in geometries very close to previous, counterpoise-corrected structures. Spin-component scaling of gradients to correct for the known shortcomings of conventional MP2 has only a small effect on geometries in most cases, but significantly alters the distance between aromatic rings in stacked complexes. Harmonic frequency calculation is made possible by efficient use of parallel computing resources, and confirms all structures to be true minima, unlike previous estimates using density functional theory. Corrections for the change in zero-point vibrational energy are determined from this data, and typically constitute between 10 and 50\% of the overall binding energy of the complex.",

	abstract = "The S22 test set of interaction energies for small model complexes [Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 8, 1985 2006] has been very valuable for benchmarking new and existing methods for noncovalent interactions. However, the basis sets utilized to compute the CCSD(T) interaction energies for some of the dimers are insufﬁcient to obtain converged results. Here we consistently extrapolate all CCSD(T)/complete basis set (CBS) interaction energies using larger basis sets for the CCSD(T) component of the computation. The revised values, which we designate S22A, represent the most accurate results to date for this set of dimers. The new values appear to be within a few hundredths of 1 kcal mol−1 of the true CCSD(T)/CBS limit at the given geometries, but the former S22 values are off by as much as 0.6 kcal mol−1 compared to the revised values. Because some of the most promising methods for noncovalent interactions are already achieving this level of agreement or better compared to the S22 data, more accurate benchmark values would clearly be helpful. The MP2, SCS-MP2, SCS-CCSD, SCS MI -MP2, and B2PLYP-D methods have been tested against the more accurate benchmark set. The B2PLYP-D method outperforms all other methods tested here, with a mean average deviation of only 0.12 kcal mol−1. However, the consistent, slight underestimation of the interaction energies computed by the SCS-CCSD method an overall mean absolute deviation and mean deviation of 0.24 and −0.23 kcal mol−1, respectively suggests that the SCS-CCSD method has the potential to become even more accurate with a reoptimization of its parameters for noncovalent interactions.",

This allows for the extrapolation of this term to the complete basis set limit, improving accuracy by almost 1 order of magnitude compared to the scheme previously used for the S66 set. Now, we estimate the largest error in the set to be about 1\%. Validation of several methods against the new data indicates the exceptional robustness and accuracy of the SCS-MI-CCSD method. The second extension improves the coverage of nonequilibrium geometries. We introduce a new data set, S66a8, that samples intermolecular angular degrees of freedom in the S66 complexes. For each of the 66 complexes, eight displaced geometries have been constructed, systematically sampling possible rotations of the monomers. Interaction energies in this set are calculated at the CCSD(T)/CBS level consistently with the earlier introduced S66x8 data set that samples the intermolecular distance.",

Various supermolecule approaches for the calculation of accurate interaction potentials are discussed. Perturbation theory of intermolecular forces is reviewed in great details. The problem of symmetry-adaptation is explained and a general symmetry-adapted perturbation theory is formulated. Convergence properties of various symmetry-adapted expansions are surveyed, and illustrated on several examples. Physical interpretation of the interaction potential in terms of the four fundamental interaction components: electrostatics, induction, dispersion, and exchange-repulsion is thoroughly exposed. Many-electron formulation of the symmetry-adapted perturbation theory in both the wave function and density functional approaches is introduced. One-center and multicenter multipole expansions neglecting the charge-overlap effects, as well as the bipolar expansion accounting for these effects are discussed. The relation of some supermolecule approaches with the perturbation theory of intermolecular forces is brieﬂy sketched. Approximate models that can be deduced from the rigorous theory of intermolecular forces, and applicable to the interactions of large systems are discussed. Finally, perturbation theory of nonadditive interactions in trimers and of the collision-induced electric properties of binary collisional complexes is also reviewed. The theory part is completed by an exposition of methods needed on the route from intermolecular potentials and collision-induced properties to physically measurable quantities such as the Raman spectra, rovibrational spectra, scattering cross sections, as well as thermodynamic, dielectric, and refractive properties of dilute gases. The present status of symmetry-adapted perturbation theory applied to the calculations of state-of-the-art ab initio potential energy surfaces and collision-induced properties is presented, and illustrated by means of applications to rovibrational spectra of Van der Waals molecules, scattering cross sections and pressure broadening coefﬁcients, collision-induced Raman spectra of atomic gases, solvation processes, and thermodynamic, dielectric, and refractive properties of dilute gases.
