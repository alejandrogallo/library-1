The intercalative binding of this drug to native calf thymus {DNA} has been studied using equilibrium dialysis, spectrophotometry, and competition with ethidium. All three techniques indicate an intrinsic association constant of approximately 1.5 x 10 M at an ionic strength of 0.01. The binding isotherm is adequately described by a neighboring-site exclusion model, and indicates a site size of approximately two base pairs. At elevated ionic strength the association constant is depressed by a factor which corresponds closely to that predicted for a monocationic ligand. Studies with a variety of synthetic polynucleotides indicate that association constants for binding sites of different sequence vary over a 10-fold range. {-AMSA} binds to heat-denatured calf thymus {DNA} or ribosomal {RNA} with association constants, respectively, 5- and 25-fold lower than that for native {DNA.} Comparable measurements have been made with related acridinylaminomethanesulfonanilide {(AMSA)} drugs and simple aminoacridines; they reveal that the presence of an unsubstituted methanesulfonanilide ring does not noticeably interfere with binding to native {DNA.} However, addition of a methoxy substituent at the 3' position of this ring, as in {-AMSA,} may sterically hinder intercalation of the acridine nucleus of the drug. The antitumor activity of the series of ligands studied could not be correlated in any straightforward fashion with nucleic acid binding parameters, although the conspicuous ability of {AMSA} drugs to discriminate sensitively between native {DNA} and {RNA} may result in efficient binding to {DNA} .",

	abstract = "Understanding the thermodynamics of drug binding to DNA is of both practical and fundamental interest. The practical interest lies in the contribution that thermodynamics can make to the rational design process for the development of new DNA targeted drugs. Thermodynamics offer key insights into the molecular forces that drive complex formation that cannot be obtained by structural or computational studies alone. The fundamental interest in these interactions lies in what they can reveal about the general problems of parsing and predicting ligand binding free energies. For these problems, drug-DNA interactions offer several distinct advantages, among them being that the structures of many drug-DNA complexes are known at high resolution and that such structures reveal that in many cases the drug acts as a rigid body, with little conformational change upon binding. Complete thermodynamic profiles (Delta G, Delta H, Delta S, Delta C-p) for numerous drug-DNA interactions have been obtained with the help of high-sensitivity microcalorimetry. The purpose of this article is to offer a perspective on the interpretation of these thermodynamics parameters, and in particular how they might be correlated with known structural features. Obligatory conformational changes in the DNA to accommodate intercalators and the loss of translational and rotational freedom upon complex formation both present unfavorable free energy barriers for binding. Such barriers must be overcome by favorable free energy contributions from the hydrophobic transfer of ligand from solution into the binding site, polyelectrolyte contributions from coupled ion release, and molecular interactions (hydrogen and ionic bonds, van dei Waals interactions) that form within the binding site. Theoretical and semiempirical tools that allow estimates of these contributions to be made will be discussed, and their use in dissecting experimental data illustrated This process, even at the current level of approximation, can shed considerable light on the drug-DNA binding process.

In the competition dialysis method, 13 different nucleic acid structures were dialyzed against a common ligand solution. More ligand accumulated in the dialysis tube containing the structural form with the highest ligand binding affinity. DNA structural forms included in the assay ranged from single-stranded forms, through a variety of duplex forms, to multistranded tripler and tetraplex forms. Left-handed Z-DNA, RNA, and a DNA-RNA hybrid were also represented. Standard intercalators (ethidium, daunorubicin, and actinomycin D) served as control compounds and were found to show structural binding preferences fully consistent with their previously published behavior. Standard groove binding agents (DAPI,dystamycin, and netropsin) showed a strong preference for AT-rich duplex DNA forms, along with apparently strong binding to the poly(da)-[poly(dT)](2) tripler. Thermal denaturation studies revealed the apparent tripler binding to be complex, and perhaps to result from displacement of the third strand. Putative tripler (BePI, coralyne, and berberine) and tetraplex [H2TmPyP, 5,10,15,20-tetrakis [4-(trimethylammonio)phenyl] -21H,23H-porphine, and N-methyl mesoporphyrin IX] selective agents showed in many cases less dramatic binding selectivity than anticipated from published reports that compared their binding to only a few structural forms. Coralyne was found to bind strongly to single-stranded poly(dA), a novel and previously unreported interaction. Finally, three compounds (berenil, chromomycin A, and pyrenemethylamine) whose structural preferences are largely unknown were examined. Pyrenemethylamine exhibited an unexpected and unprecedented preference for duplex poly(dAdT).",

Over the past 10 years there has been an increase in the number of rigorous biophysical studies of DNA-drug interactions and considerable insight has been gained into the energetics of these binding reactions. The advent of high-sensitivity calorimetric techniques has meant that the energetics of DNA-drug association reactions can be probed directly and enthalpic and entropic contributions to the binding free energy established, There are two principal consequences arising from this type of work, firstly three-dimensional structures of DNA-drug complexes from X-ray and NMR studies can be put into a thermodynamic context and the energetics responsible for stabilizing the observed structures can be more fully understood. Secondly, any rational approach to structure-based drug design requires a fundamental base of knowledge where structural detail and thermodynamic data on complex formation are intimately linked. Therefore these types of studies allow a set of general guidelines to be established, which can then be used to develop drug design algorithms. In this review we describe recent breakthroughs in duplex DNA-directed drug design and also discuss how similar principles are now being used to target higher-order DNA molecules, for example, tripler (three-stranded) and tetraplex (four-stranded) structures.

Therefore, these biomolecules represent a major target in drug development strategies designed to produce next generation therapeutics for diseases such as cancer. In order to improve the clinical efficacy of existing drugs and also to design new ones it is necessary to understand the molecular basis of drug-DNA interactions in structural, thermodynamic, and kinetic detail. The past decade has witnessed an increase in the number of rigorous biophysical studies of drug-DNA systems and considerable knowledge has been gained in the energetics of these binding reactions. This is, in part, due to the increased availability of high-sensitivity calorimetric techniques, which have allowed the thermodynamics of drug-DNA interactions to be probed directly and accurately. The focus of this article is to review thermodynamic approaches to examining drug-DNA recognition. Specifically, an overview of a recently developed method of analysis that dissects the binding free energy of these reactions into five component terms is presented. The results of applying this analysis to the DNA binding interactions of both minor groove drugs and intercalators are discussed. The solvent water plays a key role in nucleic acid structure and consequently in the binding of ligands to these biomolecules. Any rational approach to DNA-targeted drug design requires an understanding of how water participates in recognition and binding events. Recent studies examining hydration changes that accompany DNA binding by intercalators will be reviewed. Finally some aspects of cooperativity in drug-DNA interactions are described and the importance of considering cooperative effects when examining these reactions is highlighted.

The reactivation of this enzyme in immortalized and most cancer cells suggests that telomerase is a relevant target in oncology, and telomerase inhibitors have been proposed as new potential anticancer agents. In this paper, we have analyzed the selectivity of four ethidium derivatives and ethidium itself toward different G-quadruplex species, with electrospray mass spectrometry and competitive equilibrium dialysis and evaluated their inhibitory properties against telomerase. A selectivity profile may be obtained through electrospray ionization mass spectrometry {(ESI-MS),} which is in fair agreement with competitive equilibrium dialysis data. It also provides unambiguous data on the number of binding sites per nucleic acid (maximal number of two ethidium derivatives per quadruplex, in agreement with external stacking). Our experiments also demonstrate that one compound (4) is the most active and selective G-quadruplex ligand within this series and the most selective telomerase inhibitor in a modified {TRAP-G4} assay.",

Here, we examined the interactions of the {H2TMPyP4} with three distinct G-quadruplex {DNAs,} the parallel-stranded {(TG4T)4,} dimer-hairpin-folded {(G4T4G4)2,} and monomer-folded {AG3(T2AG3)3,} by ultraviolet resonance Raman spectroscopy {(UVRR),} {UVvis} absorption spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy {(SERS).} The data obtained by the continuous variation titration method show that the binding stoichiometry of {H2TMPyP4/G-quadruplex} is 2:1 for {(TG4T)4} and 4:1 for {(G4T4G4)2} or {AG3(T2AG3)3.} The results of {SERS} spectra, {UVvis} absorption titration, and fluorescence emission spectra together with the binding stoichiometries reveal that two {H2TMPyP4} molecules are externally stacked at two ends of the parallel {(TG4T)4} G-quadruplex, whereas {H2TMPyP4} molecules can intercalate within their diagonal or lateral loop regions and intervals between two G-tetrads for {(G4T4G4)2} and {AG3(T2AG3)3} G-quadruplexes.

Simple compounds, such as the polypyrroles and the bis-benzimidazoles, have been used as carriers for alkylating agents effectively directing alkylation to speciﬁc DNA sequences. The spectrum of DNA alkylation and mutation by classical alkylators, such as nitrogen mustards, has been profoundly modiﬁed by such attachment. The observed “side-by-side” binding of small polypyrrole antibiotics has led to the design of synthetic hairpin polyamides with programmable DNA sequence selectivity. These compounds are able to compete with natural substrates, such as speciﬁc transcription factors, and alter gene expression. They are being developed as artiﬁcial transcription factors, able to deliver activating peptides to speciﬁc recognition sequences, and as potential protein–DNA dimerization agents. Hairpin polyamides are also being used as carriers for the delivery of alkylators to deﬁned DNA sites. The degree of control of gene expression thus offered by the hairpin polyamides suggests enormous promise for their clinical utility.

The {DNA} quadruplex topology is parallel-stranded with external double-chain-reversal propeller loops, consistent with previous structural determinations. The porphyrin molecules bind by stacking onto the {TTA} nucleotides, either as part of the external loop structure or at the 5` region of the stacked quadruplex. This involves stacked on hydrogen-bonded base pairs, formed from those nucleotides not involved in the formation of G-tetrads, and there are thus no direct ligand interactions with G-tetrads. This is in accord with the relative nonselectivity by {TMPyP4} for quadruplex {DNAs} compared to duplex {DNA.} Porphyrin binding is achieved by remodeling of loops compared to the ligand-free structures. Implications for the design of quadruplex-binding ligands are discussed, together with a model for the formation of anaphase bridges, which are observed following cellular treatment with {TMPyP4.}",
