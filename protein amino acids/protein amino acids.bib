	abstract = "Abstract: A high-resolution, low-temperature X-ray diffraction data set on DL-histidine, collected with a CCD detector, is used in the analysis of molecular bonding and intermolecular interactions. The molecular dipole moment in the crystal is enhanced relative to that from HF and DFT calculations. Topological properties of the molecular electron density differ from theory for the polar bonds but generally agree well for the C-C bonds in the molecule. A major aim of the study is the evaluation of the electrostatic contribution to the intermolecular interactions from the experimental density. The electrostatic interaction energies between pairs of neighboring molecules, as calculated from the experimental density, compare reasonably well with the total interaction energies from supermolecule calculations. The agreement is somewhat improved by the addition of nonelectrostatic repulsion and dispersive terms, which together contribute much less than the electrostatic energy. The electrostatic interaction energy calculated from the CHARMM point-charge force field is often close to the values derived from the experimental charge density, though exceptions occur. In an alternative approach, the topology of the intermolecular charge density is related to the intermolecular interaction energy. The latter approach makes use of a density functional by Abramov (Acta Crystallogr. 1997, A53, 264-272) and a relation between the potential energy density at the bond critical point and the hydrogen bond dissociation energy (Espinosa, et al. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1998, 285, 170-173).",

	abstract = "The theory of {Atoms-In-Molecules} {(AIM)} is a partitioning of the real space of a molecule into disjoint atomic constituents as determined by the topology of the electron density, rho(r). This theory identifies an atom in a molecule with a quantum mechanical open system and, consequently, all of the atom's properties are unambiguously defined. {AIM} recovers the basic empirical cornerstone of chemistry: that atoms and functional groups possess characteristic and additive properties that in many cases exhibit a remarkable transferability between different molecules. As a result, the theory enables the theoretical synthesis of a large molecule and the prediction of its properties by joining fragments that are predetermined as open systems. The present article is the first of a series (in preparation) that explore this possibility for polypeptides by determining the transferability of the building blocks: the amino acid residues. Transferability of group properties requires transferability of the electron density rho(r), which in turn requires the transferability of the geometric parameters. This article demonstrates that these parameters are conformation-insensitive for a representative amino acid, leucine, and that the atomic and bond properties exhibit a corresponding transferability. The effects of hydrogen bonding are determined and a set of geometrical conditions for the occurrence of such bonding is identified. The effects of transforming neutral leucine into its zwitter-ionic form on its atomic and bond properties are shown to be localized primarily to the sites of ionization.",

Intermolecular interaction energies were reproduced reasonably by CAMM transformed from other conformations. Good transferability of CAMM based model was also achieved between similar molecular environments, which opens a route to modeling electrostatic effects in highly symmetric (e.g., crystalline) systems. Transferability deficiencies of various charge distribution models were analyzed and attributed to different levels of multipole expansion.",

The conformational behavior of atomic charges computed with the {MP2/6-311++G**} electron density using population analyses and partition approaches of different nature are analyzed. The behavior of every atom as well as that of molecular fragments {COOH,} {CH2} and {NH2} show that atoms in molecules {(AIM)} and natural population analysis {(NPA)} charges exhibit not only a good conformational independence but also provide a meaningful picture of the electron charge distribution in this system.",

	abstract = "The geometries of the 20 genetically encoded amino acids were optimized at the restricted {Hartree-Fock} level of theory using the {6-31+G*} basis set. A detailed comparison showed the calculated geometries to be in excellent agreement with those determined by X-ray crystallography. The study demonstrated that the geometric parameters for the main-chain group and for the bonds and common functional groups of the side-chains exhibit a high degree of transferability among the members of this set of molecules. This geometric transferability is a necessary prerequisite for the corresponding transferability of their electron density distributions and hence of their bond and atomic properties. The transferability of the electron distributions will be demonstrated and exploited in the following paper of this series, which uses the topology of the electron density to define an atom within the quantum theory of atoms in molecules. Particular features of the geometries of the amino acids are discussed. It has been shown, for example, how the apparent anomaly of the {Calpha\&bond;N} bond length in a peptide being shorter than in the charged species {Calpha\&bond;NH+3} is resolved when the charge separation is gauged by the differences in the charges of the Calpha and N atoms as opposed to the use of formal charges. A compilation of literature sources on experimental geometries covering each member of the 20 amino acids is presented. A set of rules for labeling the atoms and bonds, complementing the generally accepted {IUPAC-IUB} rules, is proposed to uniquely identify every atom and bond in the amino acids.",

	abstract = "This article presents a study of the molecular charge distributions of the genetically encoded amino acids {(AA),} one that builds on the previous determination of their equilibrium geometries and the demonstrated transferability of their common geometrical parameters. The properties of the charge distributions are characterized and given quantitative expression in terms of the bond and atomic properties determined within the quantum theory of atoms-in-molecules {(QTAIM)} that defines atoms and bonds in terms of the observable charge density. The properties so defined are demonstrated to be remarkably transferable, a reflection of the underlying transferability of the charge distributions of the main chain and other groups common to the {AA.} The use of the atomic properties in obtaining an understanding of the biological functions of the {AA,} whether free or bound in a polypeptide, is demonstrated by the excellent statistical correlations they yield with experimental physicochemical properties. A property of the {AA} side chains of particular importance is the charge separation index {(CSI),} a quantity previously defined as the sum of the magnitudes of the atomic charges and which measures the degree of separation of positive and negative charges in the side chain of interest. The {CSI} values provide a correlation with the measured free energies of transfer of capped side chain analogues, from the vapor phase to aqueous solution, yielding a linear regression equation with r2 = 0.94. The atomic volume is defined by the van der Waals isodensity surface and it, together with the {CSI,} which accounts for the electrostriction of the solvent, yield a linear regression (r2 = 0.98) with the measured partial molar volumes of the {AAs.} The changes in free energies of transfer from octanol to water upon interchanging 153 pairs of {AAs} and from cyclohexane to water upon interchanging 190 pairs of {AAs,} were modeled using only three calculated parameters (representing electrostatic and volume contributions) yielding linear regressions with r2 values of 0.78 and 0.89, respectively. These results are a prelude to the single-site mutation-induced changes in the stabilities of two typical proteins: ubiquitin and staphylococcal nuclease. Strong quadratic correlations (r2 sim 0.9) were obtained between {DeltaCSI} upon mutation and each of the two terms {DeltaDeltaH} and {TDeltaDeltaS} taken from recent and accurate differential scanning calorimetry experiments on ubiquitin. When the two terms are summed to yield {DeltaDeltaG,} the quadratic terms nearly cancel, and the result is a simple linear fit between {DeltaDeltaG} and {DeltaCSI} with r2 = 0.88. As another example, the change in the stability of staphylococcal nuclease upon mutation has been fitted linearly (r2 = 0.83) to the sum of a {DeltaCSI} term and a term representing the change in the van der Waals volume of the side chains upon mutation. The suggested correlation of the polarity of the side chain with the second letter of the {AA} triplet genetic codon is given concrete expression in a classification of the side chains in terms of their {CSI} values and their group dipole moments. For example, all amino acids with a pyrimidine base as their second letter in {mRNA} possess side-chain {CSI} le 2.8 (with the exception of Cys), whereas all those with {CSI} \&gt; 2.8 possess an purine base. The article concludes with two proposals for measuring and predicting molecular complementarity: van der Waals complementarity expressed in terms of the van der Waals isodensity surface and Lewis complementarity expressed in terms of the local charge concentrations and depletions defined by the topology of the Laplacian of the electron density. A display of the experimentally accessible Laplacian distribution for a folded protein would offer a clear picture of the operation of the ldquostereochemical coderdquo proposed as the determinant in the folding process.",
