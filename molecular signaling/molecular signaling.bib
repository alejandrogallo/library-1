	abstract = "Extended Huckel molecular orbital calculations on the histamine molecule reveal two conformations of nearly equal preference, on the basis on calculated minimum energy. Neither conformation involves intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Population analyses reveal the charge-density pattern of the imidazole ring. The dual activity of histamine is proposed to be a consequence of the existence of two preferred conformations in equilibrium. One of these conformations places the quaternary nitrogen and the (tr2trtrn)nitrogen of histamine 4.55 A apart, which is quite comparable to the 4.8 A estimated for the internitrogen distance in the antihistaminic tri-prolidine. An assignment of each histamine conformation to one of two histamine effects is provisionally made on this basis. This explanation of dual activity is comparable with that offered for a similar situation found in previous calculations on acetylcholine, muscarine, and nicotine.",

They are made on demand through cleavage of membrane precursors and are involved in various short-range signalling processes. In the brain, they combine with CB1 cannabinoid receptors on axon terminals to regulate ion channel activity and neurotransmitter release. Their ability to modulate synaptic efficacy has a wide range of functional consequences and provides unique therapeutic possibilities.",

	Pages = "2328–2340",
	abstract = "Infrared and Raman spectroscopy in H2O and D2O and quantum Density Functional calculations were used to determine the structure of histamine free-base in aqueous solution. A quantum mechanical study of the tautomeric equilibrium of histamine free-base in solution was performed at the 6-311G** level. Electronic correlation energies were included by using the hybrid functional B3LYP. The solvent was simulated as a continuum characterized by a dielectric constant, and the quantum system (solute) was placed in an ellipsoidal cavity. Solute-solvent electrostatic interaction was calculated by means a multipolar moment expansion introduced in the Hamiltonian. Four relevant histamine conformations were optimized by allowing all the geometrical parameters to vary independently, which involved both the gauche-trans and the N3H-N1H tautomerisms. The calculated free energies predicted N3H-gauche as the most stable one of histamine free-base in solution. The order of stability is here completely altered with respect to previous results in gas phase, which presented the N1H-gauche conformer as the most stable structure. Our results also differ from previous Monte Carlo simulations, which obtained the N3H-trans conformer as the most stable in solution, although in this case, the histamine structures were kept frozen to the gas-phase geometry. Vibrational spectroscopy results support theoretical ones. Quadratic force fields for the four histamine conformers were achieved under the same calculation methodology. Previously, a general assignment of the infrared and Raman spectra of histamine free-base was proposed for solutions in both natural and heavy water. This allowed us to compare the experimental set of both wavenumbers and infrared intensities with the calculated ones. The lowest quadratic mean wavenumber deviation was obtained for the N3H-gauche conformer, in agreement with the free-energy calculations. Calculated infrared intensities were also compared to the experimental intensities, supporting this conformer as the relevant structure of histamine free-base in solution. It was then selected for a complete vibrational dynamics calculation, starting with a low-level scaling procedure to fit the set of calculated wavenumbers to the experimental values. The results were presented in terms of quadratic force constants, potential energy distribution, and normal modes.",

	abstract = "We have theoretically examined the relative binding afﬁnities (RBA) of typical ligands, 17 -estradiol (EST), 17 -estradiol (ESTA), genistein (GEN), raloxifene (RAL), 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT), tamoxifen (TAM), clomifene (CLO), 4-hydroxyclomifene (OHC), diethylstilbestrol (DES), bisphenol A (BISA), and bisphenol F (BISF), to the -subtype of the human estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain (hER LBD), by calculating their binding energies. The ab initio fragment molecular orbital (FMO) method, which we have recently proposed for the calculations of macromolecules such as proteins, was applied at the HF/STO-3G level. The receptor protein was primarily modeled by 50 amino acid residues surrounding the ligand. The number of atoms in these model complexes is about 850, including hydrogen atoms. For the complexes with EST, RAL, OHT, and DES, the binding energies were calculated again with the entire ER LBD consisting of 241 residues or about 4000 atoms. No signiﬁcant difference was found in the calculated binding energies between the model and the real protein complexes. This indicates that the binding between the protein and its ligands is well characterized by the model protein with the 50 residues. The calculated binding energies relative to EST were very well correlated with the experimental RBA (the correlation coefﬁcient r 0.837) for the ligands studied in this work. We also found that the charge transfer between ER and ligands is signiﬁcant on ER–ligand binding. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst achievement of ab initio quantum mechanical calculations of large molecules such as the entire ER LBD protein.",

	abstract = "The ab initio fragment molecular orbital calculations were performed for molecular interactions of the whole estrogen receptor (ER) ligand-binding domain with a natural ligand, 17 ss-estradiol (EST). The interaction energies of the ligand at the residue level were calculated using HF and MP2 methods with several basis sets. The charge-transfer (CT) interactions were also analyzed based on configuration analysis for fragment interaction. Strong electrostatic interactions were observed between the EST and surrounding charged/polarized residues, Glu353, Arg394, His524, and Thr347. Weak electrostatic and significant van der Waals dispersion interactions were observed between the EST and the many surrounding hydrophobic residues. Together with the experimental interpretations, both interactions equally contributed to the total binding energies, and it was found that the inclusion of electron correlation was essential to obtain an appropriate picture of the interaction. The strongest interaction energy was observed between Glu353 and the EST, and the CT interactions from the lone- pair orbital of the carbonyl oxygen of Glu353 to the alpha*(OH) orbital of the hydroxyl group of EST were found to be important. The CT interactions from the lone- pair orbital of EST to the alpha*(NH) of Arg394 and from the lone- pair orbital of EST to the alpha*(NH) of His524 were also observed. These CT interactions occurred through the hydrogen-bond networks between the ER and EST. Therefore, electron donations from the ER to the EST and electron back-donations from EST to the ER were characteristic of ER-ligand binding. Our approach provides a powerful tool to understanding detailed molecular interactions at the quantum mechanical level.",

Although recent crystal structures have provided snapshots of bot hactive and inactive functional states of GPCRs, these structures do not reveal the mechanism by which GPCRs transition between these states. Here we propose an activation mechanis mfor the β2-adrenergic receptor, a prototypical GPCR, based on atomic-level simulations in which an agonist-bound receptor transitions spontaneously fro mthe active to the inactive crystallgoraphically observed conformation. A loosely coupled allosteric network, comprising three regions that cna each switch individually between multiple distinct conformations, links small perturbations at the intracellular G-protein-binding site. Out simulation also exhibit an intermediate that may represent a receptor confomation to which a G protein binds during activation, and suggest that the first structural changes during receptor actvation often take place on the intracellular side of the receptor, far from the drug-binding site. By capturing this fundamental signaling process in atomic detail, our results may provide a foundation for hte design of drugs that control receptor signaling more preceisley by stabilizing specific receptor confromations.",

	abstract = {How drugs bind to their receptors–from initial association through drug entry into the binding pocket, to adsorption of the final bound conformation, or "pose"–has remained unknown, even for G-rotein-coupled receptor modulators, which constitute one-third of all marketed drugs. We captures this pharmaceutically critical process in atomic detail using the first unbiased molecular dynamics simulations in which drug molecules spontaneously associate with G-protein-coupled receptors to achieve final poses metching those determined crystallographically. We found that several beta blockers and a beta agonist all traverse the same well-defined, dominant pathway as they bind to the β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors, intially making contact with a vestibule on each receptor's extracellular surface. Surprisingly, association with this vestibule, at a distnace of 15 Å from the binding pokcet, often present the largets energetic barrier to binding, despite the fact that subsequent entry into the binding pocket requires the receptor to deform and the drug to squeeze through a narrow passage. The early barrier appears to reflect the substantial dehydration that takes place as the drug associates with the vestibule. Our atomic-level description of the binding process suggests opportunities for allosteric modulation and provides a structural foundation for future optimization of drug–receptor binding and unbinding rates.},
