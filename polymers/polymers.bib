	abstract = "A new theory of inhomogeneous multicomponent systems is developed, starting from the functional integral representation of the partition function. The theory can be used to determine the interfacial properties and microdomain structures of a combination of homopolymers, block copolymers,monomers, and solvents. For the case of no polymers present, our theory reduces to that of Cahn and Hilliard for small molecules. In our approach, the general free energy functional is optimized by the saddle-functionmethod, subject to constraints of no volume change with mixing and constancy of the individual particle numbers, to obtain new equations for the mean fields acting on the polymers. We are thus able to restrict density fluctuations in the system, without introducing an “ad hoc” term involving a vanishing compressibility into the free energy. In addition, by using the gradient expansion for the interaction energy, we demonstrate explicitly the absence of all “kinetic” terms involving the (inverse) degree of polymerization from the mean-field equations, when we choose to introduce the local, homogeneous Flory-Huggins free energy for reference. The mathematical formalism is worked out in detail for the multicomponent homopolymer-solvent system, and it is shown how to extend the theory to include block copolymers. Finally, in order to give a definite example, the variation of the interfacial properties with molecular weight and interaction parameter is worked out numerically for the simplest case of a homopolymer-solventsystem. The numerical method is discussed in detail. Applications to more complicated systems will be given in the future.",

Such fluctuation corrections, which were neglected in the mean field treatment of Leibler, are found to be significant for the molecular weights usually encountered. The analysis is facilitated by reducing the block copolymer Hamiltonian to a form previously studied by Brazovskii. Our principal results are the following: (i) A symmetric diblock copolymer is predicted to undergo a first order phase transition at a larger value ofXN than the second order transition found by Leibler. The Flory interaction parameter is denoted X and N is the number of statistical segments per chain. The location of the transition is predicted to be at (XN)t = 10.495 + 41.022 N -1/3, where the peak in the scattering function attains its maximum value of 0.12328 N 1/3 • (ii) We find windows in composition, with finite width, through which it is possible to pass from the disordered phase to each ofthe ordered microphases (lamellar, hexagonal, and body-centered-cubic) by changing temperature. (iii) All the results of Leibler are recovered in the limit of block copolymers with infinite molecular weight.",

For small polymer–colloid size ratios the difference from an ideal description of the polymers is small, while for larger size ratios the gas–liquid coexistence region shifts in the direction of higher polymer concentrations and at the same time the liquid–crystal coexistence region becomes more extended. Both the gas–liquid region and the gas–liquid–crystal region become less extended. These features are compared to experiment.",

The majority of applications of polymeric materials is based on their excellent mechanical properties, which arise from the long-chain nature of the constituents. Microscopically, this means that polymeric materials are able to respond to external forces in a broad frequency range, i.e., with a broad range of relaxation processes. Computer simulation methods are ideally suited to help to understand these processes and the structural properties that lead to them and to further our ability to predict materials properties and behavior. However, the broad range of timescales and underlying structure prohibits any one single simulation method from capturing all of these processes.

The theoretical contributions to this effort are largely attributed to mean-ﬁeld calculations on a standard Gaussian model. Here, we review this present understanding of block copolymer phase behaviour, the model and its underlying assumptions, the mean-ﬁeld approximation and its limitations, and the attempts to incorporate ﬂuctuation corrections. Rather than following the traditional rigorous derivations, we present slightly more intuitive and transparent ones in such a way to stress the close connection between the related calculations.

The theory, derived in terms of segment density, retains the simple form of the DFTs for atomic ﬂuids. Invoking the complete bonding limit of a stoichiometric mixture in the association free energy functional yields a computationally simple and accurate functional for the polyatomic system. Comparisons of theory calculations with molecular simulations are presented for inhomogeneous solutions and blends of linear and branched chains, demonstrating the capability of the theory to accurately capture the entropic and enthalpic effects governing the microstructure.",

Our approach utilizes well known formal methods for converting ‘‘particle-based’’ statistical mechanical models of fluids into field theories, but builds on the formalism to develop practical strategies for conducting numerical simulations. This field-theoretic simulation (FTS) approach has the advantage of being efficient in treating polymeric fluids at high density and high molecular weight, unlike conventional simulation methods. I report on recent advances in the methodology and emerging applications, as well as challenges for the future.",

	abstract = "A theoretical approach combining self-consistent-field theory (SCFT) for fluids and density functional theory (DFT) for particles was applied to investigate the self-assembly behavior of amphiphilic diblock copolymer/nanoparticle mixture in dilute solution. Two kinds of hydrophobic nanoparticles are studied: one is that the particles are selective to hydrophobic blocks but are incompatible with hydrophilic blocks, and the other is that the particles are nonselective to hydrophobic and hydrophilic blocks. For both cases, the self-association of amphiphilic block copolymer/nanoparticle mixture is observed, and the nanoparticles are spatially organized in the clusters. The aggregate morphologies can be tuned by the particle radius and particle volume fraction. For the selective particles, the aggregate morphologies of amphiphilic block copolymer/nanoparticle mixture can experience a transition from vesicles to mixture of circlelike and rod micelles as the particle radius and/or particle volume fraction increase. For the nonselective nanoparticles, the large compound micelles are produced instead of the vesicles. The large compound micelles transform to the mixture of large compound micelles and circle-like micelles with an increase in particle volume fraction and/or radius. The distribution of nanoparticles in the clusters is also affected by the particle radius and volume fraction. For both cases, when the values of nanoparticle radius and/or volume fraction are small, the nanoparticles are almost uniformly distributed in the cores of micelles. However, the particles tend to localize near the interfaces between the core and shell with increasing particle volume fraction and/or radius.",

Three distinct collapsed and one extended phase are found, each phase comprising two regions with different polymeric degrees of freedom.",

	abstract = "Field-theoretic models, which replace interactions between polymers with interactions between polymers and one or more conjugate ﬁelds, offer a systematic framework for coarse-graining of complex ﬂuids systems. While this approach has been used successfully to investigate a wide range of polymer formulations at equilibrium, ﬁeld-theoretic models often fail to accurately capture the non-equilibrium behavior of polymers, especially in the early stages of phase separation. Here the ‘‘two-ﬂuid” approach serves as a useful alternative, treating the motions of ﬂuid components separately in order to incorporate asymmetries between polymer molecules. In this work we focus on the connection of these two theories, drawing upon the strengths of each of the approaches in order to couple polymer microstructure with the dynamics of the ﬂow in a systematic way. For illustrative purposes we work with an inhomogeneous melt of elastic dumbbell polymers, though our methodology will apply more generally to a wide variety of inhomogeneous systems. First we derive the model, incorporating thermodynamic forces into a two-ﬂuid model for the ﬂow through the introduction of conjugate chemical potential and elastic strain ﬁelds for the polymer density and stress. The resulting equations are composed of a system of fourth order PDEs coupled with a non-linear, non-local optimization problem to determine the conjugate ﬁelds. The coupled system is severely stiff and with a high degree of computational complexity. Next, we overcome the formidable numerical challenges posed by the model by designing a robust semi-implicit method based on linear asymptotic behavior of the leading order terms at small scales, by exploiting the exponential structure of global (integral) operators, and by parallelizing the non-linear optimization problem. The semi-implicit method effectively removes the fourth order stability constraint associated with explicit methods and we observe only a ﬁrst order time-step restriction. The algorithm for solving the non-linear optimization problem, which takes advantage of the form of the operators being optimized, reduces the overall simulation time by several orders of magnitude. We illustrate the methodology with several examples of phase separation in an initially quiescent ﬂow.",
