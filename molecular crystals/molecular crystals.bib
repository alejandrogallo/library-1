The influence of the electron correlation effects was estimated on the basis of the calculated second order Møller–Plesset corrections and their analysis. In the crystal, the urea molecules form infinite ribbons which reveal strong cooperative effects. The hydrogen-bonded interactions of the orthogonal ribbons do stabilize the crystal, whereas interactions between parallel tapes are repulsive. The stability of the crystal structure is determined by a subtle balance between these two types of interactions. Although, the electron correlation effects are stabilizing, their contribution is rather small in comparison with the total interaction energy.",

Accurate X-ray diffraction data have been collected at 100 K from a crystal of the free acid form of the coenzyme NAD+ with a CCD area detector up to 0.55 Å resolution. A multipole refinement was carried out, and the electron density of the molecule has been analyzed in order to further model its interaction with enzymes. The electron density of NAD+ has also been computed by a DFT (density functional theory) approach. The charge density and electrostatic potential obtained from experiment and theory compare well. There is a very good agreement between the theoretical and experimental charge densities for all the C-C and C-N type connections of the NAD+ molecule; this is less the case for the pyrophosphate region. The experimental electron density lone pairs of the pyrophosphate lateral oxygen atoms are distorted by hydrogen bonds effects. The electrostatic potential has large spatial extensions with highly positive and negative regions, suggesting that NAD+ is likely to interact with proteins mostly by electrostatic interactions.",

In the crystal structure the sodium ions and water molecules of adjacent unit cells form a positively charged “inorganic layer” with the sodium ions clustered together along the ab faces with the organic (negative) part in between. This puzzling crystal packing is due to a strong favorable interaction between the water molecule and the sodium ions and a substantial charge transfer from the carbanions that balances out the destabilizing sodium-sodium ion repulsion. Although the majority of cohesion energy of the crystal structure comes from the electrostatic interactions of ions, the resulting net stabilization also depends heavily on the nonadditive delocalization components, due to a counterbalance between the two-body delocalization and exchange effects. The estimated nonadditivity of interactions varies between 12\% and 22\%.",

The force-field parameters are fitted to the electrostatic potential as well as to accurate energies and forces generated by means of a hybrid method that combines solid-state density functional theory {(DFT)} calculations with an empirical van der Waals correction. All {DFT} calculations are carried out with the {VASP} program. The mathematical structure of the force field, the generation of reference data, the choice of the figure of merit, the optimization algorithm, and the parameter-refinement strategy are discussed in detail. The approach is applied to cyclohexane-1,4-dione, a small flexible ring. The tailor-made force field obtained for cyclohexane-1,4-dione is used to search for low-energy crystal packings in all 230 space groups with one molecule per asymmetric unit, and the most stable crystal structures are reoptimized in a second step with the hybrid method. The experimental crystal structure is found as the most stable predicted crystal structure both with the tailor-made force field and the hybrid method. The same methodology has also been applied successfully to the four compounds of the fourth {CCDC} blind test on crystal-structure prediction. For the five aforementioned compounds, the root-mean-square deviations between lattice energies calculated with the tailor-made force fields and the hybrid method range from 0.024 to 0.053 kcal/mol per atom around an average value of 0.034 kcal/mol per atom.",

The fundamental scientiﬁc and industrial interest in controlling crystallisation is inspiring the development of computational methods of predicting which crystal structures are thermodynamically feasible. Sometimes, computing this crystal energy landscape will reveal that a molecule has one way of packing with itself that is suﬃciently more favourable than any other so only this crystal structure will be observed. More frequently, there will be many energy minima that are energetically feasible, showing approximately equi-energetic compromises between the various intermolecular interactions allowed by the conformational ﬂexibility. Such cases generally lead to multiple solid forms. At the moment, we usually calculate the lattice energy landscape, an approximation to the real crystal energy landscape at 0 K. Despite its limitations, many studies show that this is a valuable complement to solid form screening, which helps in discovering new structures as well as rationalising the solid forms that are found in experimental searches. The range of factors that can determine which of the thermodynamically feasible crystal structures are observed polymorphs, shows the many further challenges in developing crystal energy landscapes as a tool for control of the organic solid state.",

There were 14 research groups which took part, using a variety of methods to generate and rank the most likely crystal structures for four target systems: three single-component crystal structures and a 1:1 cocrystal. Participants were challenged to predict the crystal structures of the four systems, given only their molecular diagrams, while the recently determined but as-yet unpublished crystal structures were withheld by an independent referee. Three predictions were allowed for each system. The results demonstrate a dramatic improvement in rates of success over previous blind tests; in total, there were 13 successful predictions and, for each of the four targets, at least two groups correctly predicted the observed crystal structure. The successes include one participating group who correctly predicted all four crystal structures as their ﬁrst ranked choice, albeit at a considerable computational expense. The results reﬂect important improvements in modelling methods and suggest that, at least for the small and fairly rigid types of molecules included in this blind test, such calculations can be constructively applied to help understand crystallization and polymorphism of organic molecules.",

	abstract = "A cocrystal is only expected to form if it is thermodynamically more stable than the crystals of its components. To test whether this can be predicted with a current computational methodology, we compare the lattice energies of 12 cocrystals of 4-aminobenzoic acid, 8 of succinic acid and 6 of caffeine, with the sums of the lattice energies of their components. These three molecules were chosen for their potential use in pharmaceutical cocrystals and because they had sufﬁcient determinations of cocrystals and corresponding partner crystal structures in the Cambridge Structural Database. The lattice energies were evaluated using anisotropic intermolecular atom-atom potentials, with the electrostatic model and the intramolecular energy penalty for changes in speciﬁed torsion angles derived from ab initio calculations on the isolated molecules. The majority of the cocrystals are calculated to be more stable than their components, but the energy difference is only large in a few of the cases where the partner molecule cannot hydrogen bond to itself. More typically, the cocrystal stabilization is comparable to polymorphic energy differences and some of the speciﬁcally identiﬁed errors in the computational modeling. The cocrystals will be more stable relative to the observed disordered structures of caffeine and the kinetically preferred polymorph of 4-aminobenzoic acid, highlighting kinetic factors that may be involved in cocrystal formation. Overall, it appears that cocrystal formation should generally be predictable by comparing the relative stability of the most stable cocrystal and its pure components found on the computed crystal energy landscapes, but this is often very demanding of the accuracy of the method used to calculate the crystal energy.",

	abstract = "The phenomenon of polymorphism, the ability of a molecule to adopt more than one crystal structure, is a well-established property of crystalline solids. The possible variations in physical properties between polymorphs make the reliable reproduction of a crystalline form essential for all research using organic materials, as well as quality control in manufacture. Thus, the last two decades have seen both an increase in interest in polymorphism and the availability of the computer power needed to make the computational prediction of organic crystal structures a practical possibility. In the past decade, researchers have made considerable improvements in the theoretical basis for calculating the sets of structures that are within the energy range of possible polymorphism, called crystal energy landscapes. It is common to ﬁnd that a molecule has a wide variety of ways of packing with lattice energy within a few kilojoules per mole of the most stable structure. However, as we develop methods to search for and characterize “all” solid forms, it is also now usual for polymorphs and solvates to be found. Thus, the computed crystal energy landscape reﬂects and to an increasing extent “predicts” the emerging complexity of the solid state observed for many organic molecules. This Account will discuss the ways in which the calculation of the crystal energy landscape of a molecule can be used as a complementary technique to solid form screening for polymorphs. Current methods can predict the known crystal structure, even under “blind test” conditions, but such successes are generally restricted to those structures that are the most stable over a wide range of thermodynamic conditions. The other low-energy structures can be alternative polymorphs, which have sometimes been found in later experimental studies. Examining the computed structures reveals the various compromises between close packing, hydrogen bonding, and π-π stacking that can result in energetically feasible structures. Indeed, we have observed that systems with many almost equi-energetic structures that contain a common interchangeable motif correlate with a tendency to disorder and problems with control of the crystallization product. Thus, contrasting the computed crystal energy landscape with the known crystal structures of a given molecule provides a valuable complement to solid form screening, and the examination of the low-energy structures often leads to a rationalization of the forms found.",
