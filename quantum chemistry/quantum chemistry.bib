It is found that the correlated charge distributions possess the same number and kind of critical poitns in both the $\rho(r)$ and Laplacian fields as are found for SCF charge distirbutions. Thus the topology of a charge dsitribution and the structure it defines are unaffected by the addition of Coulomb correlation. The quantitative changes in the properties of the charge density at the critical points in both $\rho(r)$ and the Laplacian induced by correlation are found to be small in magnitude and to be more pronounced for shared or covalent atomic interactions than for systems with pronounced charge transfer between the atoms.

	abstract = "The theory of atoms in molecules is extended to the case where the molecules is in the presence of an electromagnetic field. This theory is based upon a generalization of quantum mechanics to an open system, as obtained through a corresponding extension of Schinger's principle of stationary action. The extension of this principle is possible only if the open system satisfies a particular boundary condition, one which is expressed as a constraint on the variation of the action integral. This is the condition that it be nouded by a surface of zero flux in the gradient vector field of the charge density, the definition of an atom in a molecule. It is shown that this boundary constraint again suffices to define an atom as a quantum subsystem when the molecule is in the presence of an electromagnetic field. The mechanics of an open system and its properties are determined by the fluxes in corresponding vector current densities through its surface. As in the fieldfree case, the obtainment of these currents from the variation of the action integral is a direct result of the variation of the atomic durface and of the imposition of the variational constraint on its boundary. The currents in this case consist o a paramgnetic and a diamagnetic contribution, currents whose presence are a necessary requirement for the description of the properties of a system in the presence of extternal fields. The variational statement of the Heisenberg equation of motion obtained from the principle of stationary action is used to derive the Ehrenfest force and virial theorems for an atom in a molecule in teh presence of external electric and magnetic fields. In this case, the are forces acting on the interior of the atom which arise from the magnetic presures acting on its surface. it is shown that the molecular electric polarizability and magnetic susceptibility, like other properties, are rigurously expressible as a sum of atomic contributions.",

	abstract = "The role of physics in chemistry is to predict what can be observed and to provide an understanding of these observations. The dominant operational concept of chemistry is that of an atom in a molecule with a determinable and characteristic set of properties. Thus the physics of chemistry is necessarily the physics of an atom in a molecule, that is of an open system, one which is free to exchange charge and momentum with neighboring atoms. To extend the predictions of physics to the domain of chemistry it is therefore, necessary to generalize quantum mechanics to a subsystem of a total system. Such a generalization is indeed possible, but only if the open system satisfies a particular boundary condition. When this condition is met, one obtains a definition of an atom in a molecule and a prediction of its properties. Inseparable from the quantum definition of an atom in a molecule is the definition of the bonds which link the atoms to yield a molecular structure. In essence, the quantum description of an open system recovers the molecular structure hypothesis-that a molecule is a collection of atoms each with a characteristic set of properties, that are linked by a network of bonds. The emergence of this hypothesis from 19th century experimental chemistry is thus seen as having been an inevitable consequence of physics.",

It is shown that augmenting the Lagrange-function operator by the divergence of the gradient of the density operator, a process which leaves the equations of motion unaltered, leads to a class of generators whose associated infinitesimal transformations yield variations of the action-integral operator for an open system, similar in form and content to those obtained for the total, isolated system. The augmented Lagrange-function operator and the associated action-integral operator are termed proper operators, since only their variation yields equations of motion for the observables of an open system, in agreement with the expressions obtained from the field equations. Modifying the generator in this manner is shown to be equivalent to requiring that the open system be bounded by a surface through which there is a local zero flux in the gradient vector field of the electron density. Only the observables of such properly defined open systems are described by the correct equations of motion. The physical significance of such proper open systems is discussed.",

Experimentally, however, an atom in the bulk exhibits the same electron density in both samples and they possess identical sets of intensive properties. Density functional theory does not account for the fundamental observation underlying the theory of atoms in molecules: that what are apparently identical distributions of charge can be observed for an atom or a grouping of atoms in systems with different external potentials and that these atoms contribute essentially identical amounts to the energies and all other properties of the systems in which they occur. It is shown that, unlike the external potential, the kinetic energy density and the potential energy density, defined by the virial of the Ehrenfest force acting on electron density, are short-range functions. As recorded in the first article on atoms in molecules, they exhibit a local dependence on the electron density that causes them to faithfully mimic the transferability of the atomic charge distributions from one system to another. The electron, the kinetic energy, and the virial densities are all determined directly by the one-electron density matrix, a function termed near-sighted by Professor Kohn. It is this near-sighted property of the one-matrix that underlies the working hypothesis of chemistry - that of a functional group exhibiting a characteristic set of properties. The observations obtained from the theory of atoms in molecules and the atomic theorems it determines demonstrate the existence of a local relationship between the electron density and all properties of a system.",

Thus, it is through the pair density that the Lewis model of electronic structure finds physical expression. The pairing of electrons is a consequence of the Pauli principle whose effect is made manifest through the creation of the Fermi hole. The density describing the spatial distribution of the Fermi hole for an electron of given spin determines how the density of that electron is spread out in space, excluding an equivalent amount of same-spin density. The averaging of the Fermi density over single atoms or pairs of atoms determines the corresponding contributions to the total Fermi correlation. It is these terms that yield the localization and delocalization indices that determine the intra- and interatomic distribution of electron pairs that enables one to compare the pairing predicted by theory with that of a Lewis structure. The agreement is best at the {HartreeFock} level, where the Fermi hole is the sole source of correlation between the electrons. The introduction of the remaining correlation, the Coulomb correlation, disrupts the sharing of electron pairs between the atoms, and its effect is therefore, most pronounced for shared interactions. For example, Coulomb correlation reduces the number of shared pairs in N2 from the {HartreeFock} value of three to just above two. In ionic systems, the electrons are strongly localized within each atomic basin and the effect of Coulomb correlation on the atomic pairing is minimal, approaching zero over each of the atomic basins, as it does for the total molecule.",

The method avoids the MO calculation of the whole molecule and is expected to reduce the computational time drastically for large molecules. Numerical calculations were performed on propane, propanol and methylacetamide to demonstrate the accuracy of the method. The optimized geometries and the total energies were in good agreement with those from the ab initio MO calculations.",

Conspicuously absent in previous work is research on the convergence of MP$n$ spectroscopic constants, and thus complete MP$n$ (energy, $r\_e$ ,${\o}mega\_e$) series were then computed for BH, HF, CN$^{+}$ , C$\_2$ and N$\_2$) through the high orders MP25, MP21, MP13, MP39 and MP19 within the correlation consistent family of basis sets. A persistent, slowly decaying ringing pattern in the C$\_2$ energy series was tracked out to MP155. Finally, new energy series were generated and analyzed through MP167 for Cl$^{-}$ and MP39 for Ar and HCl. The MP$n$ energy and property series variously display rapid or slow convergence, monotonic or oscillatory decay, highly erratic or regular behavior, or early or late divergence, all depending on the chemical system or the choice of one-particle basis set. For oscillatory series the spectroscopic constants computed from low-order MPn methods are often more accurate, with respect to the full conﬁguration interaction FCI limit, than those computed via high-order MP$n$ theory.",

The discovered properties are not only curious but also have algorithmic value in that they enable geometrical constructions of the orthogonal basis sets and the eigenvalues of the metric matrix of the given vector set.

This is the force acting on an atom in a molecule and determining the potential energy appearing in Slater’s molecular virial theorem. The Ehrenfest force acting across the interatomic surface of a bonded pair of atoms linked by a bond paths is attractive, each atom being drawn toward the other, and the associated surface virial that measures the contribution to the energy arising from the formation of the surface is stabilizing. It is the Ehrenfest force that determines the adhesive properties of surfaces. The endothermicity of formation for X ) He or Ne is not a result of instabilities incurred in the interaction of X with the four methine carbons to which it is bonded, interactions that are stabilizing both in terms of the changes in the atomic energies and in the surface virials. The exothermicity for X = Be2+, B3+, and Al3+ is a consequence of the transfer of electron density from the hydrogen atoms to the carbon and X atoms, the exothermicity increasing with charge transfer despite an increase in the contained volume of X.",

Characterization of the factors that stabilize transition structures in solution and in enzyme active sites provides a basis for design and optimization of catalysts. Continued technological advances allowed for expansion from prototypical cases to mechanistic studies featuring detailed enzyme and condensed-phase environments with full integration of the {QM} calculations and configurational sampling. This required improved algorithms featuring fast {QM} methods, advances in computing changes in free energies including free-energy perturbation {(FEP)} calculations, and enhanced configurational sampling. In particular, the present Account highlights development of the {PDDG/PM3} semi-empirical {QM} method, computation of multi-dimensional potentials of mean force {(PMF),} incorporation of on-the-fly {QM} in Monte Carlo {(MC)} simulations, and a polynomial quadrature method for efficient modeling of proton-transfer reactions. The utility of this {QM/MM/MC/FEP} methodology is illustrated for a variety of organic reactions including substitution, decarboxylation, elimination, and pericyclic reactions. A comparison to experimental kinetic results on medium effects has verified the accuracy of the {QM/MM} approach in the full range of solvents from hydrocarbons to water to ionic liquids. Corresponding results from ab initio and density functional theory {(DFT)} methods with continuum-based treatments of solvation reveal deficiencies, particularly for protic solvents. Also summarized in this Account are three specific {QM/MM} applications to biomolecular systems: (1) a recent study that clarified the mechanism for the reaction of 2-pyrone derivatives catalyzed by macrophomate synthase as a tandem Michael−aldol sequence rather than a {Diels−Alder} reaction, (2) elucidation of the mechanism of action of fatty acid amide hydrolase {(FAAH),} an unusual {Ser-Ser-Lys} proteolytic enzyme, and (3) the construction of enzymes for Kemp elimination of 5-nitrobenzisoxazole that highlights the utility of {QM/MM} in the design of artificial enzymes.",
