These changes are contrary to those expected on the basis of aggregation or simple electrostatic effects. Characteristic changes, which suggest considerable modification of the usual helical structure of DNA, are found in the X -ray diffraction patterns of fibers of the complex with proflavine. It is inferred that these compounds, which are potent mutagens, are intercalated between adjacent nucleotide-pair layers by extension and unwinding of the deoxyribose-phosphate backbone. The hydrodynamic changes are the consequence of the diminished bending between layers, the lengthening of the molecule, and the diminished length-specific mass. The effects are fully reversible at ordinary temperatures. The proposed structural change is compatible with the normal restrictions on bond lengths, angles, and non-bonded contacts, and maintenance of the hydrogen-bonded base pairs perpendicular to the axis of the molecule. Another singly charged dye, pinacyunol, fails to elicit the effects of intercalation, yielding only lowered viscosity and increased sedimentation coefficient.",

	abstract = "The interaction between ethidium bromide and nucleic acids shows a pronounced metachromatic effect which has been used to obtain quantitative data on the process of complex formation. Ethidium binds strongly to both DNA and RNA at sites which appear to be saturated when one drug molecule is bound for every 4 or 5 nucleotides. After the primary sites have been filled, a secondary binding process can occur, leading to the precipitation of a complex containing one drug molecule bound per nucleotide. The strong primary binding to DNA is not influenced by the base-composition or by denaturation ofthe DNA, but is sensitive to changes in the salt concentration, particularly when magnesium ions are present. Addition of magnesium chloride causes a marked reduction in the strength of the interaction without significantly affecting the number of sites available to bind the drug. The process of complex formation is shown to be reversible in solution by demonstrating an exchange reaction between free and bound ethidium. Complexes between ethidium and DNA can be dissociated by using a cation-exchange resin. The binding of ethidium to DNA follows a similar pattern to that found with proflavine, suggesting that the forces involved in the binding of the two drugs may be similar.",

Recent studies from this laboratory reveal distinct differences in the thermodynamic binding mechanisms between m-AMSA and o-AMSA (Wadkins \& Graves, 1989), with the m-AMSA-DNA interaction being an enthalpy-driven process while the binding of o-AMSA to D N A is characterized by more positive entropy values. T o further examine the physical chemical properties associated with these compounds and their correlation with antitumor activities, an in-depth investigation into the thermodynamic parameters of these compounds and structurally related anilinoacridine analogues was performed. These studies demonstrate that substituent type and position on the aniline ring of the anilinoacridines greatly influences both the affinities of these drugs in binding to D N A and dictates whether the D N A binding is an enthalpy- or entropy-driven process. The differences in thermodynamic mechanisms of binding between the two isomers along with molecular modeling studies reveal the electronic and/or steric factors resulting from the positioning of the methoxy substituent group on the anilino ring directs the DNA-binding properties through orientation of the methanesulfonamido group a t the 1’ position of the aniline ring. The orientation of this substituent group may result in favorable contacts through hydrogen bonding with neighboring base pairs and ultimately influence the biological effectiveness as an antitumor agent.",

Three cellular proteins of 70, 85, and 110 kDa coimmunoprecipitated with the octamer motif-binding protein Oct-2 because of the presence of contaminating DNA in the cell extracts. In addition, heterodimer formation between Oct-1 (or Oct-2) and Pit-1 during protein-affinity chromatography was stabilized by the contaminating DNA.

All of these except hydroxyrubicin carry a net charge of +1 a t neutral pH, arising from the protonation of the daunosamine moiety. Hydroxyrubicin is a synthetic anthracycline antibiotic in which the amine moiety has been replaced by a hydroxyl group, whicfi is uncharged but polar at neutral pH. The comparative binding studies we describe offer a unique opportunity to evaluate the electrostatic contributions to the D N A binding free energy of these anthracycline antibiotics and to test specific predictions arising from current polyelectrolyte theory as applied to ligand-DNA interactions. We find that the quantity (6 log K/6 log [M+]) changes from a value of -0.95 for doxorubicin to -0.18 for hydroxyrubicin. The latter value is in excellent agreement with the value of -0.24 predicted by the theory of Friedman and Manning for the interaction of an uncharged intercalating ligand with DNA. The D N A binding free energy decreases from -8.8 kcal mol-' for doxorubicin to -7.2 kcal mol-' for hydroxyrubicin under solution conditions of 200 mM Na+, p H 7.0, 20 OC. The results we obtain allow us to dissect the D N A binding free energy into its electrostatic and nonelectrostatic components. Knowledge of these values helps to clarify the precise role of the amine group in doxorubicin binding to DNA. In addition, comparison of the D N A binding of doxorubicin with the /3 anomer of doxorubicin provides a striking example of stereoselective antibiotic binding to DNA.",

	abstract = "The mechanism of intercalation into DNA double helices by ethidium has been analyzed by temperature-jump relaxation and stopped-flow measurements using fluorescence detection. Artifacts due to field- or flow-induced alignment have been eliminated by measurements under magic angle conditions; the theoretical basis for suppression of orientation effects resulting from external forces is given for the case of fluorescence measurements. Excluded site effects have been avoided by restriction to low degrees of binding. The temperature-jump relaxation observed for ethidium binding to DNA could be described by single exponentials under most conditions. The reciprocal time constants increased linearly with the DNA concentration, leading to association rate constants of 2.7 X lo6 M-l s-1 a t 12 OC. These rate constants are virtually independent of the DNA chain length for samples with 200,500,4228, and 30 000 base pairs, showing that the rate is controlled by reaction and not by a diffusive process. At high DNA concentrations around 200 pM, an additional relaxation effect with an amplitude opposite to the main one is observed which is probably due to some conformational change of the DNA-ethidium complex. The results obtained by stopped-flow measurements are consistent with those from T-jump measurements, but owing to higher amplitudes and better signal to noise ratios, the stopped-flow data clearly require two exponentials for satisfactory representation. The reciprocal time constants for both processes increase linearly with the DNA concentration. The simplest mechanism consistent with this result involves parallel formation of two different complexes with a direct transfer of ethidium between the binding sites. The experimental data for a synthetic D N A with one type of base pairs, poly[d(A-T)], are very similar to those for natural DNA; thus, the relatively complex reaction mechanism of intercalation is not due to base-pair heterogeneity. Apparently the two complexes are formed by intercalation of ethidium between the base pairs from the directions of the major and the minor grooves of the double helix. Our results demonstrate that the Joule temperature-jump technique does not introduce artifacts due to field-induced processes, when this technique is used with appropriate care.",

Since the {pKa} shift is directly related to the total electrostatic binding free energy of the charged and neutral forms of the ligand, the accuracy of the calculations implies that the electrostatic contributions to binding are accurately predicted as well. Based on our results, we have developed a general physical description of the electrostatic contribution to {ligand-DNA} binding in which the electrostatic binding free energy is described as a balance between the coulombic attraction of a ligand to {DNA} and the disruption of solvent upon binding. Long-range coulombic forces associated with highly charged nucleic acids provide a strong driving force for the interaction of cationic ligands with {DNA.} These favorable electrostatic interactions are, however, largely compensated for by unfavorable changes in the solvation of both the ligand and the {DNA} upon binding. The formation of a {ligand-DNA} complex removes both charged and polar groups at the binding interface from pure solvent while it displaces salt from around the nucleic acid. As a result, the total electrostatic binding free energy is quite small. Consequently, nonpolar interactions, such as tight packing and hydrophobic forces, must play a significant role in {ligand-DNA} stability.",

Determination of the salt concentration dependence of the binding constant allowed us to dissect the DNA binding free energy of each compound into its component nonelectrostatic and polyelectrolyte contributions. Comparison of the nonelectrostatic free energy contribution allowed us to evaluate the net energetic contribution of specific functional groups to DNA binding. These quantitative data revealed a surprisingly large and favorable energetic contribution (2 kcal mol(-1)) of the groove-binding daunosamine moiety and a substantial energetic penalty for alteration of its stereochemistry, The energetic cost of removal of hydroxyl groups at the C-9 and C-14 positions (which structural studies indicate may participate in hydrogen-bonding interactions with the DNA) was approximately 1 kcal mol(-1). Replacement of the 3'-amino group with a hydroxyl group led to a loss of 0.7 kcal mol(-1) in binding free energy, above and beyond the energetic penalty resulting from the removal of its positive charge from the antibiotic. The results and analysis presented here provide a rigorous and detailed description of structure-DNA affinity relationships among anthracycline antibiotics. The results are of general interest in understanding how total ligand binding free energies are partitioned among substituents and will be useful in the formulation of rules for the rational design of novel DNA binding agents.",

The structure of the latter was compared with structures obtained from x-ray crystallography and nmr spectroscopy, as well as the theoretically derived ldquoalternating {B-DNArdquo} model {[A.} Klug et al. (1979), Journal of Molecular Biology, Vol. 131, p. 669]. The alternation of twist angles observed in experimental structures was reproduced in the simulation. All four independent simulations of the {drug-DNA} intercalation complex converged in placing the pyridine ring of the ellipticine chromophore in the major groove; in one case this involved a 180° rotation of the drug at the intercalation site. At a more detailed level, the drug is seen to be capable of adopting several distinct orientations, each stable over a period of hundreds of picoseconds. Despite the presence of several polar groups in the drug, however, no direct hydrogen bonding to the {DNA} occurs; instead, interactions between the methyl groups of the drug and the thymine bases at the intercalation site appear important in determining the orientational preferences of the drug. Comparison of the intercalation complexes with the free {DNA} sequence shows a degree of unwinding resulting from intercalation, in good agreement with experimental results, but spread over the three central base-pair steps, not confined to the intercalation site itself. Measurements of torsional rigidity indicate only a slight stiffening of the {DNA} restricted to the immediate site of intercalation. The structures obtained from the {MD} simulations were used to calculate theoretical {CD} spectra, with separate simulations giving very different results. This appears to indicate that given an accurate assignment of the main electronic transition dipole moment of the ellipticine chromophore, discrimination of the more realistic binding geometries may be possible. The relative merits of the various drug orientations observed in the simulations are discussed and a perpendicular orientation of the drug at the intercalation site is considered to be the most consistent with experimental data. While the simulations themselves represent a total of over 2 ns, however, the differences apparent between independent runs indicate that longer simulation times will be required before a complete, unequivocal view of {DNA} intercalation is obtained. © 1996 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.",

These show acceptable agreement if derived from several independent NMR signals. Less reliable information is obtained from selected UV titrations, from DNA melting differences, from calorimetric measurements and from affinity comparison to polyamines, the latter being based on a fluorescence assay with ethidium bromide. In contrast to literature expectations the naphthalene-shaped ligands show similar affinities irrespective of the presence of nitrogen atoms, or even of charges within the aromatic system, Quinolinium and naphthalene derivatives only intercalate if they bear a positively charged side chain, and then with similar binding constants. Comparison of all systems as well as salt effects demonstrate that the binding can be quantified with additive contributions from salt bridges of the ammonium centres in the side chains, and from the stacking effects of the aromatic parts. There is no evidence for non-classical intercalation by partial insertion between the nucleobases, nor for any intercalation of phenyl units.",

The transition moment polarizations of 9-hydroxyelliptiycine were determined in polyvinyl alcohol stretched film. Spectroscopic solution studies of the {DNA/drug} complex are combined with theoretical {CD} calculations using the final 50 ps of a series of molecular dynamics simulations as input. The spectroscopic data shows 9-hydroxyellipticine to adopt two main binding modes, one intercalative and the other a stacked binding mode involving the formation of drug oligomers in the {DNA} major groove. Analysis of the intercalated binding mode in {poly[d(A-T)]2} suggests the 9-hydroxyellipticine hydroxyl group lies in the minor groove and hydrogen bonds to water with the pyridine ring protruding into the major groove. The stacked binding mode was examined using resonance light scattering and it was concluded that the drug was forming small oligomer stacks rather than extended aggregates. Reduced linear dichroism measurements suggested a binding geometry that precluded a minor groove binding mode where the plane of the drug makes a 45° angle with the plane of the bases. Thus it was concluded that the drug stacks in the major groove. No obvious differences in the mode of binding of 9-hydroxyellipticine were observed between different {DNA} sequences; however, the stacked binding mode appeared to be more favorable for calf thymus {DNA} and {poly[d(G-C)]2} than for {poly[d(A-T)]2,} an observation that could be explained by the slightly greater steric hindrance of the {poly[d(A-T)]2} major groove. A strong concentration dependence was observed for the two binding modes where intercalation is favored at very low drug load, with stacking interactions becoming more prominent as the drug concentration is increased. Even at {DNA} : drug mixing ratios of 70:1 the stacked binding mode was still important for {GC-rich} {DNAs.} © 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc. Biopoly 46: 127-143, 1998",

There will be a significant electrostatic contribution to the binding energy for chromophores with a predominantly positive electrostatic potential, but this varies significantly with sequence, and somewhat with twist angle. The usefulness of these potential maps for understanding the binding of intercalators is explored by calculating the electrostatic Binding energy for 9-aminoacridine, ethidium, and daunomycin in a variety of model binding sites. The electrostatic forces play a major role in the positioning of an intercalating 9-aminoacridine and a significant stabilizing rob in the binding of ethidium in its sterically constrained position, but the intercalation of daunomycin is determined by the side-chain binding. Sequence preferences are likely to be determined by a complex and subtle mixture of effects, with electrostatics being just one component. The electrostatic binding energy is also unlikely to be a major determinant of the twist angle, as its variation with angle is modest for most intercalation sires. Overall the electrostatic potential maps give guidance on how positively charged chromophores can be chemically adapted by heteroatomic substitution to optimise their binding.

The general features of the amiloridebase and amiloridebase pair intermolecular potential energy surfaces were found to be different in the case of adenine and thymine compared to guanine and cytosine, resulting in more orientational and translational freedom for amiloride in the former case. In addition, the interaction of amiloride with adenine and thymine nucleobases is significantly more dispersion-controlled than that with guanine and cytosine, where the electrostatic energy contributes up to a third of the total intermolecular energy. Amiloride in the base pair complexes is overlapped with guanine and adenine.

Published van’t Hoff plots were reanalyzed to obtain ∆Cp values of -337 to -423 cal mol-1 K-1 for the binding of actinomycin D to several DNA oligonucleotide duplexes with defined sequences.

Some of them are valuable drugs currently used for the treatment of ovarian and breast cancers and acute leukemias, while many others are in different phases of clinical trials. Intercalating agents share common structural features such as the presence of planar polyaromatic systems which bind by insertion between DNA base-pairs, with a marked preference for 5'-pyrimidine-purine-3' steps. The chromophores are linked to basic chains that might also play an important role in the affinity and selectivity shown by these compounds. Bisintercalators have two potential intercalating ring systems connected by linkers which can vary in length and rigidity. Nowadays it is well accepted that the antitumor activity of intercalators is closely related to the ability of these compounds to stabilize the DNA-intercalator-topoisomerase II ternary complex. In this work we have carried out a revision of small organic molecules that bind to the DNA molecule via intercalation, and exert their antitumor activity through a proven topoisomerase II inhibition. We have tried to give a general overview of the most recent results in this area, paying special attention to compounds that are currently under clinical trials.

A further investigation of the effects of drug binding performed with 292 bp mixed-sequence DNA fragments, and using increment in contour length as a reliable measure of intercalation, revealed saturation occurring at a point where sufficient drug was present to interact with every other available binding site. Moment analysis based on the distribution of angles between segments along single DNA molecules showed that at this level of bis-intercalation, the apparent persistence length of the molecules was 91.7 +/- 5.7 nm, approximately twice as long as that of naked DNA. We conclude that images of single molecules generated using AFM provide a valuable supplement to solution-based techniques for evaluation of physical properties of biological macromolecules.",

All intercalators exhibit large charge delocalization, and none of them (including the DAPI dication) exhibits a site with dominant charge. All intercalators have large polarizability and are good electron acceptors, while base pairs are good electron donors. MP2/6-31G*(0.25) stabilization energies of intercalator(...)base pair complexes are large (E(...)AT, 22.4 kcal/mol; D(...)GC, 17.8 kcal/mol; EL(...)GC, 18.2 kcal/mol; DAPI(...)GC, 21.1 kcal/mol) and are well reproduced by modified AMBER potential (van der Waals radii of intercalator atoms are enlarged and their energy depths are increased). Standard AMBER potential underestimates binding, especially for DAPI-containing complexes. Because the DAPI dication is the best electron acceptor (among all intercalators studied), this difference is explained by the importance of the charge-transfer term, which is not included in the AMBER potential. For the neutral EL molecule, the standard AMBER force field provides correct results. The Hartree-Fock and DFT/B3LYP methods, not covering the dispersion energy, fail completely to reveal any energy minimum at the potential energy curve of the E(...)AT complex, and these methods thus cannot be recommended for a study of intercalation process. On the other hand, an approximate version of the DFT method, which was extended to cover London dispersion energy, yields for all complexes very good stabilization energies that are well comparable with referenced ab initio data. Besides the vertical dependence of the interaction, an energy twist dependence of the interaction energy was also investigated by a reference correlated ab initio method and empirical potentials. It is concluded that, despite the cationic (E + 1, D + 1, DAPI + 2) or polar (EL) character of the intercalators investigated, it is the dispersion energy which predominantly contributes to the stability of intercalator(...)DNA base pair complexes. Any procedure which does not cover dispersion energy is thus not suitable for studying the process of intercalation.",

There has been intense interest in the DNA binding sequence specificity of these compounds in recent years, with the hope that a compound could be identified that could possibly modulate gene expression or exhibit reduced toxicity. To computationally analyze this phenomenon, we have constructed molecular models of 65 doxorubicin analogues and their complexes with eight distinct DNA octamer sequences. The HINT (Hydropathic INTeractions) program was utilized to describe binding, including differences in the functional group contributions as well as sequence selectivity. Of these 65 compounds, two compounds were calculated to have a selectivity (the calculated DeltaDeltaG(sel) between the sequence with the strongest binding and the second strongest binding sequence) greater than -0.75 kcal mol(-1) for one sequence over all others, 10 compounds were specific between -0.50 and -0.74 kcal mol(-1), 18 compounds were specific between -0.25 and -0.49 kcal mol(-1), and 35 compounds were virtually nonspecific with a DeltaDeltaG below -0.24 kcal mol(-1). Several compounds have been identified from this study that include features which may enhance sequence selectivity, including several with a halogen in lieu of the 4'-OH in the daunosamine sugar, one compound with a nonaromatic six-membered ring (pirarubicin) in place of the 4'OH, and a compound with an aromatic ring in the vicinity of the C-14 region (zorubicin). Removal of the methoxy group at the C-4 position on the aglycone portion also appears to add potency and selectivity (idarubicin). Overall, efficient computational methods are presented that can be utilized to analyze the free energy of binding and sequence selectivity of both known and designed analogues of doxorubicin to identify future lead compounds for further experimental research.",

The measurement of local compressibilities from the spectral hole shifts under pressure allowed the assignment of binding modes of thionin to the DNA strands. Thionin binds via external stacking to the dimeric hairpin quadruplex and binds to the monomeric quadruplex only by Coulombic interaction, whereas it intercalates into a linear GC-duplex structure.

	abstract = "Daunomycin is one of the most important agents used in anticancer chemotherapy. It interacts with {DNA} through intercalation of its planar chromophore between successive base pairs. The effect of intercalation on structure, dynamics and energetics is the topic of a wealth of scientific studies. In the present study, we report a computational examination of the energetics of the intercalation process. In detail, we concentrate on the energetic penalty that intercalation of daunomycin introduces into {DNA} by disturbing it from its unbound conformation. For these means, we are analyzing already published molecular dynamics simulations of {daunomycin-DNA} complexes and present novel simulations of a {bisdaunomycin-DNA} and a {9-dehydroxydaunomycin-DNA} intercalated complex using the {MM-GBSA} module implemented in the {AMBER} suite of programs. Using this molecular dynamics based, continuum solvent method we were able to calculate the energy required to form an intercalation site. Consequently, we compare the free energy of the duplex {d(CGCGCGATCGCGCG)2} in the B-form conformation with the respective conformations when intercalated with daunomycin and a bisintercalating analog. Our results show that the introduction of one single intercalation site costs [{\textasciitilde}]32 kcal/mol. For double intercalation, or intercalation of the bisintercalator, the respective value for one intercalation site decreases to 27 and 24 kcal/mol, respectively, at a theoretical salt concentration of 0.15 M. This proposes that at least in these cases, a synergistic effect takes place. Although it is well known that intercalation leads to substantial disturbance of the {DNA} conformation, already performed investigations suggest a lower energetic penalty. Nevertheless to the best of our knowledge the calculations presented here are the most complete ones and consider hydration effects for the first time. The interaction energy between the ligand and the {DNA} certainly over-compensates this penalty for introducing the intercalation site and thus favors complexation. Such analyses are helpful for the description of allosteric effects in protein ligand binding.",

Analysis of the results obtained on complexes consisting of 1 {EtBr} bound/10 bp leads to the following conclusions: (i) Raman markers diagnostic of {DNA} phosphodiester conformation are converted from the B type to the A type with {EtBr} binding, commensurate with the proportion of ethidium-bound nucleotides in the complex. (ii) Ethidium binding converts deoxynucleoside sugar puckers from the C2`-endo to the C3`-endo conformation, also consistent with binding stoichiometry. Both pyrimidine and purine deoxynucleoside sugar puckers are perturbed by the phenanthridinium ring intercalation. (iii) Phenanthridinium insertion between bases is accomplished with no apparent change in hypochromicities of purine or pyrimidine Raman markers, indicating that basephenanthridinium interactions provide compensatory hypochromic effects. (iv) Novel Raman markers of helix unwinding have been identified and assigned primarily to methylene deformation modes of the deoxyribosyl {C2`H2} and {C5`H2} groups.

While the imino form fully intercalates into the {DNA} base pairs, the amino form is only partially intercalated. In addition, a broad hole associated with an antihole appeared in the presence of {DNA,} particularly in {GC} base pairs. The coincidence of the antihole with the absorption band of the amino form showed that the amino form is the photoproduct of the imino form.

Enediyne 1 is triggered by NADPH in a strongly exothermic reaction (-88 kcal/mol), which involves a number of intermediate steps. Untriggered 1 has a high barrier for the Bergman cyclization (52 kcal/mol) that is lowered after triggering to 16.7 kcal/mol due to an epoxide opening and the accompanying strain relief. The Bergman reaction of triggered 1 is slightly exothermic by 2.8 kcal/mol. The singlet biradical formed in this reaction is kinetically stable (activation enthalpies of 19.5 and 21.8 kcal/mol for retro-Bergman reactions) and is as reactive as para-benzyne. The activity-relevant docking mode is an edge-on insertion into the minor groove, whereas the intercalation between base pairs, although leading to larger binding energies, excludes a triggering of 1 and the development of its biological activity. Therefore, an insertion-intercalation model is developed, which can explain all known experimental observations made for 1. On the basis of the insertion-intercalation model it is explained why large intercalation energies suppress the biological activity of dynemicin and why double-strand scission can be achieved only in a two-step mechanism that involves two enediyne molecules, explaining thus the high ratio of single-strand to double-strand scission observed for 1.",

However, the contribution of the backbone to intercalation free energy is difficult to appreciate given the intertwined energetics associated with intercalation (e.g., pipi stacking and solvent effects). Fluorescence titrations were used to determine the association constants of two known intercalators, proflavine and ethidium, for duplex 2`,5`-linked {RNA.} Proflavine was found to bind 2`,5` {RNA} with an association constant 25-fold greater than that measured for standard, 3`,5`-linked {RNA.} In contrast, ethidium binds 2`,5` {RNA} less favorably than standard {RNA.}",

The stabilization energy of the cationic intercalators is considerably larger than that of the uncharged one. The dominant energy contribution with all intercalators is represented by dispersion energy. In the case of the cationic intercalators, the electrostatic and charge-transfer terms are also important. The DG of ethidium intercalation to DNA was estimated at À4.5 kcal molÀ1 and this value agrees well with the experimental result. Of six contributions to the final free energy, the interaction energy value is crucial. The intercalation process is governed by the non-covalent stacking (including charge-transfer) interaction while the hydrogen bonding between the ethidium amino groups and the DNA backbone is less important. This is confirmed by the evaluation of the interaction energy as well as by the calculation of the free energy change. The intercalation affects the macroscopic properties of DNA in terms of its flexibility.

	abstract = "The binding of small molecules to double stranded DNA including intercalation between base pairs has been a topic of research for over 40 years. For the most part, however, intercalation has been of marginal interest given the prevailing notion that binding of small molecules to protein receptors is largely responsible for governing biological function. This picture is now changing with the discovery of nuclear enzymes, e.g. topoisomerases that modulate intercalation of various compounds including certain antitumor drugs and genotoxins. While intercalators are classically ﬂat, aromatic structures that can easily insert between base pairs, our laboratories reported in 1977 that a number of biologically active compounds with greater molecular thickness, e.g. steroid hormones, could ﬁt stereospeciﬁcally between base pairs. The hypothesis was advanced that intercalation was a salient feature of the action of gene regulatory molecules. Two parallel lines of research were pursued: (1) development of technology to employ intercalation in the design of safe and effective chemicals, e.g. pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, agricultural chemicals; (2) exploration of intercalation in the mode of action of nuclear receptor proteins. Computer modeling demonstrated that degree of ﬁt of certain small molecules into DNA intercalation sites correlated with degree of biological activity but not with strength of receptor binding. These ﬁndings led to computational tools including pharmacophores and search engines to design new drug candidates by predicting desirable and undesirable activities. The speciﬁc sequences in DNA into which ligands best intercalated were later found in the consensus sequences of genes activated by nuclear receptors implying intercalation was central to their mode of action. Recently, the orientation of ligands bound to nuclear receptors was found to match closely the spatial locations of ligands derived from intercalation into unwound gene sequences suggesting that nuclear receptors may be guiding ligands to DNA with remarkable precision. Based upon multiple lines of experimental evidence, we suggest that intercalation in double stranded DNA is a ubiquitous, natural process and a salient feature of the regulation of genes. If double stranded DNA is proven to be the ultimate target of genomic drug action, intercalation will emerge as a cornerstone of the future discovery of safe and effective pharmaceuticals.",

The intercalation interaction of protonated daunomycin with two stacked DNA base pairs was studied through a hybrid approach in which intercalation is treated at LDA/TZP while the molecular structure of daunomycin and hydrogen-bonded Watson-Crick pairs is computed at BP86/TZ2P. We find that the affinity of the drug for the six considered base pair dimers decreases in the order AT-AT > AT-TA > GC-AT > GC-TA > GC-CG > GC-GC, in excellent agreement with experimental data on the thermodynamics of the interaction between daunomycin and synthetic polynucleotides in aqueous solution.

These allow a molecular level understanding of aspects of the thermodynamics, {DNA} structural changes, and kinetic pathways of the intercalation process.

The proposed model is based on calculating the effective persistence length of two entropic springs associated in series, one intercalated with drug molecules and the other without drugs. As the total drug concentration in the sample increases, the lengths of the two entropic springs vary, modifying the effective persistence length. The theoretical predictions of this model are then compared to experimental results, and a good accordance was obtained.",

	abstract = "The interaction of proﬂavine (PR) with two B-DNA decamers of alternating AT and GC sequence, called [deca(dG-dC)]2 and [deca(dA-dT)]2, respectively, was computationally investigated by the ONIOM method, exploiting a three-layer QM/QM/MM hybrid approach. The highest level QM method was applied to the model system, which comprises the intercalation site (5th and 6th base pairs) and the inserted PR molecule. The connecting sugar phosphate backbone was added in the medium layer region. Both higher and medium level layers, differing in the size of the basis set used, were treated by the DFT MPWB1K functional. The full system in the lower layer was described by the empirical AMBER force ﬁeld. The calculated values of the interaction energy of PR with [deca(dG-dC)]2 and [deca(dA-dT)]2, as well as with the dinucleotides d(GpC)2, and d(ApT)2, the latter considered either in vacuo and in the mimicked water solvent, support for a static higher afﬁnity toward G-C compared to the A-T DNA base sequences, in agreement with structural results from crystallographic studies. Furthermore, the different structural characteristics of the [deca(dG-dC)]2/PR complex compared to those of the [deca(dA-dT)]2/PR, furnish a possible interpretation of apparently controversial experimental thermodynamic data, explained in terms of two possible modes of non-covalent binding of ligands with DNA, namely intercalation and external binding, respectively.",

	abstract = "Noncovalent complexes of a tumorigenic benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide with the guanine-cytosine (GC) and adenine-thymine (AT) base pairs have been examined computationally. (+)-BaP DE-2 forms covalent adducts with DNA via nucleophilic attack on the (+)-BaP DE-2 epoxide. Computational results predict ﬁve thermodynamically accessible complexes of AT with (+)-BaP DE-2 that are compatible with intact DNA. Among these, two are expected to lead to adenine adducts. In the lowest energy AT · · · (+)-BaP DE-2 complex, which has a gas-phase interaction energy of -20.9 kcal mol-1, the exocyclic NH2 of adenine is positioned for backside epoxide attack and formation of a trans adduct. The most energetically favorable complex leading to formation of a cis ring-opened adduct lies only 0.6 kcal mol-1 higher in energy. For GC · · · (+)-BaP DE-2, there are only two thermodynamically accessible complexes. The higher-lying complex, bound in the gas phase by 24.4 kcal mol-1 relative to separated GC and (+)-BaP DE-2, would lead to a trans ring-opened N2-guanine adduct. In the global minimum energy GC · · · (+)-BaP DE-2 complex, bound by 27.3 kcal mol-1, the exocyclic NH2 group of cytosine is positioned for cis epoxide addition. However, adducts of (+)-BaP DE-2 with cytosine are rarely observed experimentally. The paucity of cytosine adducts, despite the predicted thermodynamic stability of this GC · · · (+)-BaP DE-2 complex, is attributed to the electrostatic destabilization of the benzylic cation intermediate thought to precede cis addition.",

	abstract = "The RNA world hypothesis proposes that nucleic acids were once responsible for both information storage and chemical catalysis, before the advent of coded protein synthesis. However, it is difficult to imagine how nucleic acid polymers first appeared, as the abiotic chemical formation of long nucleic acid polymers from mononucleotides or short oligonucleotides remains elusive, and barriers to achieving this goal are substantial. One specific obstacle to abiotic nucleic acid polymerization is strand cyclization. Chemically activated short oligonucleotides cyclize efficiently, which severely impairs polymer growth. We show that intercalation, which stabilizes and rigidifies nucleic acid duplexes, almost totally eliminates strand cyclization, allowing for chemical ligation of tetranucleotides into duplex polymers of up to 100 base pairs in length. In contrast, when these reactions are performed in the absence of intercalators, almost exclusively cyclic tetra- and octa-nucleotides are produced. Intercalator-free polymerization is not observed, even at tetranucleotide concentrations >10; 000-fold greater than those at which intercalators enable polymerization. We also demonstrate that intercalation-mediated polymerization is most favored if the size of the intercalator matches that of the base pair; intercalators that bind to Watson–Crick base pairs promote the polymerization of oligonucleotides that form these base pairs. Additionally, we demonstrate that intercalation-mediated polymerization is possible with an alternative, non-Watson–Crick-paired duplex that selectively binds a complementary intercalator. These results support the hypothesis that intercalators (acting as ‘molecular midwives’) could have facilitated the polymerization of the first nucleic acids and possibly helped select the first base pairs, even if only trace amounts of suitable oligomers were available.",

Two possible binding orientations of ellipticine in a DNA double helix were studied, and the orientation with the pyrrole nitrogen exposed into a major groove was identiﬁed as the more probable. The conﬁgurational entropy change of DNA is shown to contribute signiﬁcantly to the binding free energy. The magnitude of this contribution depends on the exact DNA sequence. A detailed analysis revealed that the largest ﬂexibility changes occurred in the sugar-phosphate backbone, resulting in an entropy gain in the most cases. The nucleobases were not involved in the changes of ﬂexibility and entropy. BI/BII-like conformational transitions were observed after the intercalation of ellipticine, and the consequences of these transitions for the evaluation of entropy are discussed.",

At variance to non-methylated analogues, novel methylated derivatives interacted with DNA/RNA not only at pH 5 but also at pH 7, and some compounds switched the DNA binding mode from the minor groove binding (non-methylated derivatives) to the intercalation (novel, methylated derivatives). Moreover, selective ds-RNA over ds-DNA thermal stabilization of previously observed non-methylated derivatives was reversed for novel, methylated derivatives. The variation of a linker length connecting two ureaephenanthridinium conjugates regulated their binding modes toward double stranded polynucleotides. All novel compounds were able to distinguish between polynucleotides of AeT(U) and GeC basepair composition by a speciﬁc ﬂuorescence change. Moreover, the introduction of the permanent positive charge on the phenanthridinium moiety resulted in significantly higher biological potency in respect to non-methylated analogues.",
