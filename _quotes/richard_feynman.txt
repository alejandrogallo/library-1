Character of Physical Law: (..) the inverse square is what permits it to become local; if it were the inverse cube it could not be done that way. At the other end of the equation, the fact that the force is related to the rate of change of velocity is what permits the minimum principle. (..) If you modify the laws much you find that you can only write them in fewer ways.
Character of Physical Law: Mathematicians are only dealing with the structure of reasoning, and they do not really care what they are taling about. They do not even need to know what htey are talking about, or, whether what they say is true.
Character of Physical Law: It always bothers me that, according to the laws as we understand them today, it takes a computing machine an infinite number of logical operations to figure our what goes on in no matter how tiny a region in space, and no matter how tiny a region in time. (..) So I have often made the hypothesis that ultimately physics will not require a mathematical statement, and the laws will turn out to be simple.
Character of Physical Law: An understanding of fundamental laws does not necessarily give an undesrtanding of things of significance in the world in any direct way.
