A theorem is provided showing that the standard counterpoise approach, in which, at a given geometry, energies are evaluated using the full basis set of the complex, yields a pure (i.e. BSSE-free) interaction energy. Artifacts resulting from secondary BSSE have been found to become negligible before the basis set limit of this interaction energy is attained. Alternative methods in which counterpoise is achieved by restricting the fragment description in the calculation of the full complex to the level used for the isolated fragment are formally nearly correct but have been found to give less satisfactory results, mainly because the relevant fragment properties converge only slowly to the basis set limit. Some practical aspects are considered as well, such as the ambiguities that arise in calculating the binding energy of a cluster of molecules.",

Upon optimization on the CP-corrected surface, the interaction energies become more negative before vibrational corrections and the H-bonding stretching vibrations decrease in all cases.

Alternative interpretations of the BB scheme are compared and some problems and paradoxes are described which can consistently be resolved by introducing a hierarchical scheme of N-body CP corrections. In CHA, one identifies those terms of the Hamiltonian (or Fockian) which cause the BSSE-the same terms cause the energy lowering in the “ghost orbitals” calculations; by omitting these terms from the Hamiltonian (Fockian), one can calculate BSSE-free wave functions, by use of which the BSSE-free values of the energy and of other physical quantities can be obtained in a conventional manner. CHA was successfully applied at the SCF and DET levels of theory, including systems containing three or more interacting subsystems or even infinite periodic chains. The pivot full CI calculations performed for small model systems showed the applicability of the approach for treating electron correlation as well. Mast recently, a CHA version of the MP2 theory and a second-order BSSE-free intermolecular PT have also been tested; they are also applicable for complexes of larger size. It was observed, at any level of theory, that the results given by the a posteriori BB and a priori CHA schemes converge to each other much faster than BSSE disappears from the uncorrected results.

The zeroth order Hamiltonian is built up on the BSSE-free but not orthogonal and not necessarily real canonic CHA–SCF orbitals and their orbital energies. As the exclusion of BSSE makes the problem nonHermitian, biorthogonal perturbation theory is used to obtain the ﬁrst order wave function. The second order energy is, however, calculated by using the conventional Hermitian Hamiltonian, in accord with the ‘‘CHA with conventional energy’’ recipe. For that reason we use a generalized Hylleraas functional introduced recently; this guarantees the second order energy to be real even in the case of complex CHA–SCF orbitals. The matrix elements entering the generalized Hylleraas functional are calculated by transforming all wave functions, creation and annihilation operators to an auxiliary orthonormalized basis. The new CHA-MP2 method has been tested on a number of van der Waals complexes and hydrogen bonded systems, by using a variety of different basis sets. In all cases a remarkable agreement has been found with the results given by the Boys and Bernardi’s counterpoise method CP ; this agreement is especially striking in the case of large and well-balanced basis sets. This indicates that the conceptually different CHA and CP schemes both take into account correctly the major BSSE effects.",

This is illustrated for a molecule (a conformer of the Tyr-Gly dipeptide) for which B3LYP/6-31+G(d) and MP2/6-31+G(d) geometry optimizations yield strikingly different structures [Mol. Phys. 2006, 104, 559-570]: MP2 predicts a folded “closed-book” conformer with the glycine residue located above the tyrosine ring, whereas B3LYP predicts a more open conformation. By employing different levels of theory, including the local electron correlation methods LMP2 (local MP2) and LCCSD(T0) (local coupled cluster with single, double, and noniterative local triple excitations) and large basis sets (aug-cc-pVnZ, n = D, T, Q), it is shown that the folded MP2 minimum is an artifact caused by large intramolecular BSSE (basis set superposition error) effects in the MP2/6-31+G(d) calculations. The B3LYP functional gives the correct minimum, but the potential energy apparently rises too steeply when the glycine and tyrosine residues approach each other, presumably due to missing dispersion effects in the B3LYP calculations. The PWB6K and M052X functionals, designed to give good results for weak interactions, remedy this to some extent. The reduced BSSE in the LMP2 calculations leads to faster convergence with increasing basis set quality, and accurate results can be obtained with smaller basis sets as compared to canonical MP2.

Furthermore we carried out molecular dynamics simulations enforcing the self-dissociation reaction of the water dimer to study the influence of the basis set onto the reaction. Not surprisingly, we find strongly varying results of the calculated forces for a chosen cutoff along the reaction coordinates. The basis set superposition errors of the dimer interaction energy are analyzed along the free-energy surface, i.e., along the trajectories. Based on the analysis along the trajectories a qualitative and quantitative estimate depending on the particular point of the free-energy surface can be provided. Namely, at the intermolecular O center dot center dot center dot H distance close to the equilibrium geometry the errors are smaller than at shorter O center dot center dot center dot H distances. However, the distribution at the equilibrium distance is more unsymmetrical than the distribution at short distances. It is wider, and the standard deviation is larger than at shorter distances where the basis set superposition error is larger.

'the planar optimized structures turn out to be transition states presenting one or more large imaginary frequencies, whereas single-determinant-based methods lead to the expected planar minima and no imaginary frequencies. It has been suggested that such anomalous behavior can be originated by two-electron basis set incompleteness error. In this work, we show that the reported pitfalls can be interpreted in terms of intramolecular basis set superposition error (BSSE) effects, mostly between the C-H moieties constituting the arenes. We have carried out counterpoise-corrected optimizations and frequency calculations at the Hartree-Fock, B3LYP, MP2, and CISD levels of theory With several basis sets for a number of arenes. In all cases, correcting for intramolecular BSSE fixes the anomalous behavior of the correlated methods, whereas no significant differences are observed in the single-determinant case. Consequently, all systems studied are planar at all levels of theory.

We demonstrate that conventional BSSE correction techniques such as the Counterpoise method can account for this wrong behavior and provide proper correction whenever spurious results occur, mainly in case of thymine, uracil and guanine but also to lower extent for adenine and cytosine. We also show that special care must be taken when assessing the BSSE by means of ghost-orbital calculations for strongly overlapping fragments. Often molecular orbitals in the isolated fragment calculation have a different orientation as in the ghost-orbital calculation. This can lead to bogus derivatives of the CP-correction term, essential to account for geometry and vibrational BSSE effects.

The Valiron-Mayer function counterpoise (VMFC), site-site function counterpoise (SSFC) and TB methods have been employed in order to obtain the incremental optical components of linear hydrogen fluoride clusters (HF)n, where n = {3,4}. Following Mierzwicki and Latajka, who have performed similar calculations for the interaction energy, we compare those three methods of eliminating BSSE using several Dunning's correlation consistent basis sets.
