While it is true that increase in temperature will accelerate division rate and many means are known to retard or prevent cell division, the evidence that mitosis, except in the case of special tissues, can be initiated or accelerated by definite compounds or by any means (except heat) is far from convincing. This is particularly true in the case of mitogenetic rays of Gurwitsch (1923), rays given off by cells or cell extracts that will induce division in another cell.",

	abstract = "Anti-Ro/SSA antibodies are the antinuclear antibodies most commonly found in everyday clinical practice and are closely associated with Sjogren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus and neonatal lupus. They play a pathogenic role in a variety of clinical manifestations, including skin lesions and neonatal lupus heart block. Autoantibodies to Ro(SS-A) recognize a ribonucleoprotein complex composed of small single-stranded RNAs (hYRNAs) and of one or more peptides. Four molecular forms of this complex have been differentiated based on the nature of the peptide: a lymphocyte and an erythrocyte Ro with a 60 kDa peptide, a lymphocyte Ro with a 52 kDa peptide and an erythrocyte Ro with a 54 kDa peptide. The Ro complex is found in most tissues and cells (erythrocytes, platelets), with differences in structure and quantity across tissues, species and embryonic development stages. Although its function remains unknown, its ability to bind nucleic acids and the fact that it shares homologies with gene regulation proteins suggest that it may participate in RNA transcription processes. A number of environmental factors (exposure to ultraviolet radiation, viral infections) may cause translocation of the Ro complex to nucleocytoplasmic and membrane sites where it is not normally found, thereby leading to the development of autoimmunity. The structure of the Ro(SS-A)-hYRNA complex and the development of autoimmunity are currently the focus of active research efforts that can be expected to improve our understanding of the clinical manifestations directly related to anti-Ro(SS-A) antibodies.",

There are small molecules that specifically bind to quadruplex DNA, inhibit telomerase, and are cytotoxic towards tumor cells indicating a role for quadruplex DNA in telomere function. It is now possible to make testable proposals for the possible biological implications of quadruplex DNA in replication, transcription: and recombination as well as possible routes to therapeutic intervention.",

This has lead to a disconnection between the concept of lipid rafts as derived from biochemical and biophysical assays and their existence in the cell. Here, we compare the concept of lipid rafts as it has emerged from the study of synthetic membranes with the reality of lateral heterogeneity in biological membranes. Further application of existing tools and the development of new tools are needed to understand the dynamic heterogeneity of biological membranes.",
