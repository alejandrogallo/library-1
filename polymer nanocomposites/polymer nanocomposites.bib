	abstract = "Various nylon 6-clay hybrids, such as molecular composites of nylon 6 and silicate layers of montmorillonite and saponite, NCH's and NCHP's, respectively, have been synthesized. To estimate the mechanical properties of these hybrids, tensile, flexural, impact, and heat distortion tests were carried out. NCH was found superior in strength and modulus and comparable in impact strength to nylon 6. The heat distortion temperature (HDT) of NCH (montmorillonite: 4.7 wt. \%) was 152-degrees-C, which was 87-degrees-C higher than that of nylon 6. In NCHP, saponite had a smaller effect on the increase of these mechanical properties. The modulus and HDT of NCH and NCHP increased with an increase in the amount of clay minerals. It was found that these properties were well described by the contribution of the constrained region calculated from the storage and loss modulus at the glass transition temperature. According to the mixing law on elastic modulus, the following expression was obtained between the modulus E at 120-degrees-C and the fraction of the constrained region C, E(n) = E(c)n . C, where the values of n and E(c) (modulus of the constrained region) were 0.685 and 1.02 GPa, respectively.",

Caprolactam was polymerized in the interlayer of montmorillonite, a layer silicate, yielding a nylon 6-clay hybrid (NCH). The silicate layers of montmorillonite were uniformly dispersed in nylon 6. The carboxyl end groups of 12-aminolauric acid in 12-montmorillonite initiated polymerization of epsilon-caprolactam, and as 12-montmorillonite content became larger, the molecular weight of nylon was reduced. From the result of end-group analysis, carboxyl end groups were more than amino end groups. The difference between the carboxyl and the amino end groups was attributed to ammonium cations (-NH3+) of nylon molecules, because the difference agreed with the anion site concentration of the montmorillonite in NCH. It is suggested that the ammonium cations in nylon 6 interact with the anions in montmorillonite.",

The materials design and synthesis rely on the ability of layered silicates to intercalate in the galleries between their layers a wide range of monomers and polymers. Special emphasis i placed on a new, versatile and environmentally benign synthesis approach by polymer melt intercalation. I0contrast to in-situ polymerization and solution intercalation, melt intercalation involves mixing the layered silicate with the polymer and heating the mixture above the softening point of the polymer. Compatibility with various polymers is accomplished by derivatizing the silicates with alkyl ammonium cations via an ion exchange reaction. By hetuning the surface characteristics nanodispersion (i.e. intercalation or delamination) can be accomplished. The resulting polymer layered silicate (PLS) nanocomposites exhibit properties dramatically different from their more conventional counterparts. For example, PLS nanocomposites can attain a particular degree of stiffoesr, strength and barrier properties with far less inorganic content than comparable glass- or mineral reinforced polymers and, therefore, they are far lighter i weight. In addition, PLS nanocomposites exhibit significant increase in thermal stability as well as self-extinguishing characteristics. The combination of improved properties, convenient processing and low cost has already led to a few commercial applications with more currently under development.",

	abstract = "We develop a computer simulation for the dynamic behavior of a phase-separating binary mixture that contains mobile, solid particles. The system models “filled polymers”, which contain not only a blend of different macromolecules, but also solid fillers. We focus on the case where one of the components preferentially wets the surface of the particles. By combining a mesoscopic, coarse-grained description of the fluids with a discrete model for the particles, we show that the addition of hard particles significantly changes both the speed and the morphology of the phase separation. To probe the late-stage properties of the system, we also develop a mean-field rate-equation model for the mixture. The results indicate that the phase separation is arrested in the late stage; the “steady-state” domain size depends strongly on both the particle diffusion constant and the particle concentration. To obtain insight into the effects of processing on the properties of such composites, we also investigated the behavior of the binary fluid/particle mixture under shear. For sufficiently large particle densities, we find that the anisotropic growth caused by the imposed shear is destroyed by the randomly moving particles, and the domains are isotropic in shape even for large shear strains. Finally, we apply our models to mixtures of diblock copolymers and fillers. Overall, our findings reveal how the solid additives can be used to tailor the morphology of the complex mixture, and thereby control the macroscopic properties (such as mechanical integrity) of the composite.",

The potential strength is obtained from scaling arguments for the cross virial coefficient of true colloid–polymer systems.

The role of energy on the POMF was investigated by varying the strength of the polymer–nanoparticle interaction and comparing structure and POMF with those obtained for an athermal model. All features of the POMF as a function of nanoparticle separation were found to be strongly correlated with the polymer matrix density, the structure of the polymer at the nanoparticle interface, and the structure of the polymer in the interparticle region. The POMF was not found to correlate with polymer chain dimensions e.g., radius of gyration in contrast to colloidal suspensions in dilute and semidilute solutions. Both energy and entropy effects were found to make important contributions to the POMF.

This paper represents a preliminary investigation into the feasibility of examining such relatively large systems using atomistic modeling techniques. No attempt is made here to model any specific system. A generic linear polymer “united-atom” model is first created in an amorphous phase before the insertion of an atomistically detailed silica nanoparticle of diameter 4.4 nm. A novel method to insert a nanoparticle into a polymer matrix is given. The entire system is contained in a standard periodic simulation cell of side length ∼10 nm. The volume fraction of silica corresponded to 4.5\%. The composite system was subsequently relaxed at 300 K and at two different pressures using standard MD techniques, the gmq suite of programs being used for this purpose. Results are presented regarding the variation of the structure and dynamics of the system with respect to the distance from the polymer-nanoparticle interface and as a function of pressure. A clear structuring of the polymer chains around the nanoparticle is seen with prominent first and second peaks in the radial density function and a concurrent development of preferred chain orientation. The probability of trans conformers is also higher close to the interface and shows a distinct gradient. In contrast, evidence for chain immobilization is less obvious overall although dynamic properties are more sensitive to changes in the pressure. Comparisons are also made between the bulk moduli of the pure polymer and composite systems.",

Smectites are a valuable mineral class for industrial applications because of their high cation exchange capacities, surface area, surface reactivity, adsorptive properties, and, in the case of hectorite, high viscosity and transparency in solution. In their pristine form they are hydrophilic in nature, and this property makes them very difﬁcult to disperse into a polymer matrix.

The inﬂuence of particle size, degree of polymerization, and polymer reduced density is established. In the athermal limit, the surface excess is negative implying an entropic dewetting interface. Polymer induced depletion interactions are quantiﬁed via the particle-particle pair correlation function and potential of mean force. A transition from nearly monotonic decaying, attractive depletion interactions to much stronger repulsive-attractive oscillatory depletion forces occurs at roughly the semidilute-concentrated solution boundary. Under melt conditions, the depletion force is extremely large and attractive at contact, but is proceeded by a high repulsive barrier. For particle diameters larger than roughly ﬁve monomer diameters, division of the force by the particle radius results in a nearly universal collapse of the depletion force for all interparticle separations. Molecular dynamics simulations have been employed to determine the depletion force for nanoparticles of a diameter ﬁve times the monomer size over a wide range of polymer densities spanning the semidilute, concentrated, and melt regimes. PRISM calculations based on the spatially nonlocal hypernetted chain closure for particle-particle direct correlations capture all the rich features found in the simulations, with quantitative errors for the amplitude of the depletion forces at the level of a factor of 2 or less. The consequences of monomer-particle attractions are brieﬂy explored. Modiﬁcation of the polymer-particle pair correlations is relatively small, but much larger effects are found for the surface excess including an energetic driven transition to a wetting polymer-particle interface. The particle-particle potential of mean force exhibits multiple qualitatively different behaviors contact aggregation, steric stabilization, local bridging attraction depending on the strength and spatial range of the polymer-particle attraction.",

The calculations reveal that a high volume fraction of relatively large particles are localized in the notch. Here, the polymer melt induces a depletion attraction between the particles and surface and thereby drives the nanoparticles into the defect. The time required for these relatively large particles to migrate to the notch is comparable to the time needed for the chains to move by approximately four radius of gyrations. The morphology obtained from the MD simulation serves as the input to the lattice spring model (LSM), which allows us to determine the mechanical properties of the nanocomposite-coated surface.

Using this model, we explore the rich nanostructures formed from self-assembly of the NBBs and make analogies with the morphologies observed in block copolymer, surfactant, and liquid crystalline systems. On the basis of the assembled structures produced and determination of the location and nature of the order-disorder transitions in the system, we propose phase diagrams to describe the behavior of these molecules.

	abstract = "A detailed computational study of the potential of mean force between a pair of spherical particles dissolved in a homopolymer melt has been performed using microscopic liquid state theory. The role of particle-to-monomer diameter ratio, degree of polymerization, strength and spatial range of monomer-particle attractions, and direct interfiller attractions has been established. Beyond the small particle regime, the potential of mean force scales linearly with the particle-to-monomer diameter ratio. This simple scaling allows the construction of master curves and the quantification of material specific aspects independent of the filler-to-monomer diameter ratio. For hard-sphere fillers, four general categories of polymer-mediated organization are found: contact aggregation due to depletion attraction, segment level tight particle bridging, steric stabilization due to thermodynamically stable “bound polymer layers”, and “tele-bridging” where distinct adsorbed layers coexist with longer range bridging. The conditions on the strength and spatial range of monomer-particle attractive interactions that define these different modes of organization have been established. Direct interparticle van der Waals attractions favor contact aggregation and thus compete with the rich polymer-mediated behavior. As the direct attractions increase in strength, the globally stable noncontact bridging configuration is gradually destabilized and replaced by contact aggregation as the most favored state of packing. However, bridging states often remain as metastable local minima. Steric stabilization systems are much less affected by direct interfiller attractions due to the thermodynamic stability of distinct bound polymer layers. This suggests design rules for achieving good particle dispersion. In addition, the interesting possibility is raised that sterically stabilized nanofillers may crystallize in a homopolymer matrix at relatively low volume fractions. Our results have implications for nonequilibrium phenomena such as gelation or filler network formation and kinetic stabilization via large repulsive barriers, which are qualitatively discussed.",

However, crack formation is a critical problem in these materials; thus, designing layered systems that can respond to environmental changes and undergo self-healing is particularly important for a range of technologies. Here, nanoparticles dispersed in a polymer matrix were found to migrate to a crack generated at the interface between the polymer and a glassy layer. Segregation of the nanoparticles to the crack depended on both the enthalpic and entropic interactions between the polymer and nanoparticles. In particular, poly(ethylene oxide)-covered 5.2-nm spherical nanoparticles in a poly(methyl methacrylate) matrix diffused to cracks in the adjoining silicon oxide layer, whereas tri-n-octylphosphine oxide-covered nanoparticles did not. These results point to a simple means of fabricating systems that can self-heal, improving the durability of multilayered systems, or form the basis for auto-responsive materials.",

For hard fillers, two distinct phase separation behaviors, separated by a miscibility window, are generically predicted. One demixing curve occurs at relatively low monomer-particle attraction strength and corresponds to a very abrupt transition from an entropic depletion attraction-induced phase separated state to an enthalpically stabilized miscible fluid. The homogeneous mixture arises via a steric stabilization mechanism associated with the formation of thin, thermodynamically stable bound polymer layers around fillers. The second demixing transition occurs at relatively high monomer-particle adsorption energy and is inferred to involve the formation of an equilibrium physical network phase with local bridging of particles by polymers. This spinodal is sensitive to both particle-monomer diameter ratio and the spatial range of the interfacial attraction. The miscibility window narrows, and can ultimately disappear, with increasing polymer chain length, direct van der Waals attractions between fillers, and/or particle-monomer size asymmetry ratio. The implications of our results for the design of well-dispersed thermodynamically stable polymer nanocomposites, and the formation of nonequilibrium gels, are discussed.",

Because it creates capillary pressure on a NP, this “universal” wetting layer is proposed to be responsible for NP embedding. The value of h* is independent of the molecular weight of PS and constant during the embedding process. The value of h* is found to be similar to the equilibrium wetting layer thickness of a polymer melt spreading on a metal substrate. Using a model that includes the spreading coefficient, long-range van der Waals interactions, and a chain-stretching penalty, h* is shown to be independent of the molecular weight of the polymer. Using this model and the measured value of h*, the interfacial energy between Au NP and PS is estimated to be 8.7 J/m2.",

Increasing filler volume fraction has a profound effect on the polymer matrix, inducing oscillatory reorganization on a length scale commensurate with the nanoparticle diameter. The near contact interfacial monomer-filler pair correlations are suppressed by nanoparticle addition, but on larger scales power law correlations emerge with filler imprinted oscillatory features. Increased nanoparticle volume fraction also substantially changes interfiller packing, inducing a transition from a highly bridged or sterically stabilized type of organization in the infinite dilution limit to more diffuse liquidlike packing characterized by many-particle clustering. Distinctive modifications of the collective polymer structure factor include an increase in the osmotic compressibility, the emergence of a large bound layer or microphase-separation-like scattering peak on a length scale controlled by filler size indicative of distinct bound polymer layers, and a local rarefaction and suppression of the coherence of the monomer cage scale packing. All the real and Fourier space correlations depend in distinctive manners on the physical and chemical variables (filler size, volume fraction, strength and spatial range of the interfacial cohesion) and proximity to the contact aggregation and bridging phase separation boundaries. The bulk modulus of the nanocomposite generically softens with the addition of fillers corresponding to enhanced total density fluctuations.",

With respect to the neat matrix, nanoparticle dispersion has been shown to enhance physical (e.g., barrier, erosion resistance, and reduced flammability), thermomechanical (e.g., heat distortion temperature, thermal expansion coefficient, and stiffness), and processing (e.g., surface finish and melt strength) characteristics. Beyond maximization of the nanoparticle dispersion, however, the morphology of these materials is many times uncontrolled, yielding isotropic nanofilled systems, not necessarily spatially “engineered, designed and tailored” materials. To impact high-technology applications requiring unique electrical, thermal, and optical properties, manufacturing techniques enabling control of the nanoparticle arrangement and distribution must be developed. This paper will examine the status of approaches for directing the hierarchical morphology of nanoparticle dispersions in three dimensions, and beyond uniaxial alignment, using examples from the literature to highlight the potential and issues.

After an introduction providing the main motivations (Section 1), an overview of the basic phenomenology and recent experimental results is presented (Section 2), with special emphasis on the Payne effect and related aspects. In Section 3, we discuss results of equilibrium molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations of polymer chains in the presence of nanoparticles. After a concise theoretical description, these are compared with those obtained from integral equation and density functional approaches (Section 4). The molecular origins of the inter-particle-depletion interaction are discussed, as well as the phase-separation diagram of the nanoparticle/polymer system. The related issue of polymer chains and networks compressed between planar surfaces is also dealt with.

The blends are modeled as a mixture of hard spheres and freely jointed hard chains, near a hard wall. There is a ﬁrst order phase transition present in these blends in which the nanoparticles expel the polymer from the surface to form a monolayer at a certain nanoparticle concentration. The nanoparticle transition density depends on the length of the polymer, the nanoparticle diameter, and the overall bulk density of the system. The phase transition is due to both packing entropy effects related to size asymmetry between the components and to the polymer conﬁgurational entropy, justifying the so-called “entropic push” observed in experiments. In addition, a layered state is found at higher densities which resembles that in colloidal crystals, in which the polymer and nanoparticles form alternating discrete layers. We show that this laminar state has nearly the same free energy as the homogeneously mixed ﬂuid in the bulk and is nucleated by the surface.",

In this review, we ﬁrst introduce some computational methods that have been applied to polymer nanocomposites, covering from molecular scale (e.g., molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo), microscale (e.g., Brownian dynamics, dissipative particle dynamics, lattice Boltzmann, time-dependent Ginzburg–Landau method, dynamic density functional theory method) to mesoscale and macroscale (e.g., micromechanics, equivalent-continuum and self-similar approaches, ﬁnite element method). Then, we discuss in some detail their applications to various aspects of polymer nanocomposites, including the thermodynamics and kinetics of formation, molecular structure and dynamics, morphology, processing behaviors, and mechanical properties. Finally, we address the importance of multiscale simulation strategies in the understanding and predictive capabilities of polymer nanocomposites in which few studies have been reported.

We demonstrate that spherical nanoparticles uniformly grafted with macromolecules (‘nanoparticle amphiphiles’) robustly self-assemble into a variety of anisotropic superstructures when they are dispersed in the corresponding homopolymer matrix. Theory and simulations suggest that this self-assembly reﬂects a balance between the energy gain when particle cores approach and the entropy of distorting the grafted polymers. The effectively directional nature of the particle interactions is thus a many-body emergent property. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach to nanoparticle self-assembly enables considerable control for the creation of polymer nanocomposites with enhanced mechanical properties. Grafted nanoparticles are thus versatile building blocks for creating tunable and functional particle superstructures with signiﬁcant practical applications.",

We thus conclude that, at low loadings, the polymer “forces” the nanoparticle “defects” out of their way to crystallize in a minimally perturbed form. For higher loadings, the crystals become smaller in response to increased particle induced confinement. In contrast to currently held views that the particles control the crystallization process, e.g., by providing heterogeneous nucleation sites, we find that the crystalline lamellae dominate; i.e., they manipulate the nanoparticle dispersion, especially at low loadings.",

	abstract = "We have recently shown that silica nanoparticles grafted with polystyrene chains behave akin to block copolymers due to the “dislike” between the nanoparticles and the grafts. These decorated nanoparticles, thus, self-assemble into various morphologies, from well-dispersed nanoparticles to anisotropic superstructures, when they are placed in homopolystyrene matrices of different molecular masses. Here, we consider a slightly different case, where the grafted chains and the matrix (both PMMA) are strongly attracted to the silica nanoparticle surface. We then conjecture that these systems show phase mixing or demixing depending on the miscibility between the brush and matrix chains (“autophobic dewetting”). At 15 mass \% particle loading, composites created using the same grafted nanoparticle, but with two different matrices, yield well dispersed nanoparticles or nanoparticle “agglomerates”, respectively. Rheology experiments show that the composites display solid-like behavior only when the particles are aggregated. As deduced in previous work, this difference in behavior is attributed to the presence of percolating particle clusters in the agglomerated samples which allows for stress propagation through the system. Going further, we compare the local mobility of matrix and grafted segments of both composites using quasi-elastic neutron scattering experiments. For the liquid-like system, the mean square displacements of the grafted chains and matrix chains, the particle structuring and mechanical response are all unaffected by annealing time. In contrast, in the reinforced case, only the local matrix motion is unaffected by time. Since the particle clustering and solid-like mechanical reinforcement increase with increasing time, we conclude that mechanical reinforcement in polymer nanocomposites is purely based on the nanoparticles, with essentially no “interference” from the matrix. In conjunction with other results in the literature, we then surmise that mechanical reinforcement is caused by the bridging of particles by the grafted polymer layers and not due to the formation of “glassy” polymer layers on the nanoparticles.",

For spherical nanoparticles dispersed in a polymer matrix the results indicate that the chain motion exhibits three distinct regions of diffusion, the Rouse-like motion, an intermediate subdiffusive regime followed by a normal Fickian diffusion. The motion of the chain end monomers shows a scaling that can be attributed to the formation of strong “networklike” structures, which have been seen in a variety of polymer nanocomposite systems. Irrespective of the polymer-particle interaction strengths, these three regimes seem to be present with small deviations. Further investigation on dynamic structure factor shows that the deviations simply exist due to the presence of strong enthalpic interactions between the monomers with the nanoparticles, albeit preserving the anomaly in the chain diffusion. The time-temperature superposition principle is also tested for this system and shows a striking resemblance with systems near glass transition and biological systems with molecular crowding. The universality class of the problem can be enormously important in understanding materials with strong afﬁnity to form either a glass, a gel or networklike structures.",

	abstract = "We studied by small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) the polymer chain conformation in model silica/polystyrene (PS) nanocomposites. Using the zero average contrast method, we can properly match silica signal to directly measure the form factor of a single PS chain. An important effort has been put to eliminate the silica scattering using two distinct approaches (called respectively “three” and “four” components methods) leading to analogue results. By combining SANS data with small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements and transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) images on the same samples, we obtain a very clear result about the effect on polymer chain conformation of the filler dispersion, either at low filler volume fraction, where silica arrange in small aggregates or at higher concentration where it forms a connected network. From SANS the chain conformation in nanocomposites is identical to the one without silica in a large q range illustrating that the chain conformation remains independent of the filler dispersion whatever the silica connectivity or the polymer molecular weight. This result opens the way to a better overview of the polymer chain conformation contribution, especially adsorption or chain mobility modification effects, in the complex mechanical reinforcement mechanisms of nanocomposites. However, at low q, an unexpected shoulder appears in the SANS curves: this effect does not vary in a systematic way neither with chain molecular weight nor with silica concentration. The non reproducibility of these observations could be related to unusual phase separation between normal and deuterated chains.",

This review focuses on three aspects that are central to the outstanding problem of realizing these promised property improvements. First, we ask if there exist general strategies to control nanoparticle spatial distribution. This is an important question because it is commonly accepted that the nanoparticle dispersion state crucially affects property improvements. Because ideas on macroscale composites suggest that optimizing different properties requires different dispersion states, we next ask if we can predict a priori the particle dispersion and organization state that can optimize one (or more) properties of the resulting nanocomposite. Finally, we examine the role that particle shape plays in affecting dispersion and hence property control. This review focuses on recent advances concerning these underpinning points and how they affect measurable properties relevant to engineering applications.",

By introducing nanoscale filler components, greater enhancement in mechanical function compared to traditional macro- and microscale fillers is possible due to the greater surface area and lower percolation thresholds stemming from the higher aspect ratios of the nanoscale fillers. In this Perspective, we will discuss polymer nanocomposites drawing from the lessons of wood (network of preformed, high-modulus cellulose nanorods), spider silk (self-assembly of ordered domains), and tendon (hierarchical ordering).",

However, identiﬁcation of polymeric systems for universal fouling control is often impeded by the poor knowledge of interactions between biological substances and polymeric substrates in diverse aqueous environments. In this article, we review predictions of the polymer density functional theory (DFT) on the structural and surface properties of polymer brushes and polymer nanocomposites that are potentially useful for antifouling applications. In comparison to alternative theoretical methods, DFT exhibits versatile features that are ideal for investigating various polymer-mediated interactions, self-organization of nanoparticles, and surface-induced phase transitions. It is capable of explicit description of important microscopic details of polymeric systems including the molecular excluded-volume effects, associating interactions, van der Waals attraction, Coulomb forces, and inter- and intra- molecular correlations. The theoretical descriptions of surface forces may provide helpful guidelines in the design and development of polymeric materials for preventing non-speciﬁc adsorption of biological substances.",

Simulated results indicate that the interfacial region is composed of partial segments of different polymer chains, which is consistent with the experimental results presented by Chen et al. {(Macromolecules,} 2010, 43, 1076). Moreover, it is found that the interfacial region is within one single chain size {(Rg)} range, irrespective of the polymer-filler interaction and the filler size, beyond which the bulk behavior appears. In the interfacial region, the orientation and dynamic behaviors are induced by the interfacial enthalpy, while the size and conformation of polymer chains near the filler are controlled by the configurational entropy. In the case of strong polymer-filler interaction (equivalent to the hydrogen bond), the innerest adsorbed polymer segments still undergo adsorption-desorption process, the transport of chain mass center in the interfacial region exhibits away from the glassy behavior, and no plastic-like yielding point appears in the stress-strain curve, which indicates that although the mobility of interfacial polymer chains is restricted, there exist no "polymer glassy layers" surrounding the filler. In addition, it is evidenced that the filler particle prefers selectively adsorbing the long polymer chains for attractive polymer-filler interaction, validating the experimental explanation of the change of the bound rubber {(BR).} In short, this work provides important information for further experimental and simulation studies of polymer-nanoparticle interfacial behavior.},
