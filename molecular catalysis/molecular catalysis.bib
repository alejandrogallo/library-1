	abstract = "The catalytic or inhibitory activity of a molecular environment has been quantitatively represented as the difference between the interaction energies of the transition complex and the substrate complex with catalyst, and it has been further decomposed into the electrostatic multipole, electrostatic penetration, exchange, induction and dispersion contributions defined within exchange perturbation theory. A sample analysis of catalytic activity of the first hydration shell has been performed for the reaction CO2 + H20 -> H2CO3 within the LCAO MO SCF ab initio approach. Results indicate a significant contribution of the electrostatic multipole term in the overall catalytic activity. However, the remaining electrostatic penetration, exchange, induction and dispersion interactions seem to be non-negligible but cancelling each other to a great extent, justifying some intuitively assumed electrostatic hypotheses on’the nature of catalytic activity. More approximate models of gradually increasing simplicity have been briefly outlined based on cumulative atomic multipole expansion and nonempirical short range atom-atom potentials, making it possible to deal with much larger molecular systems and to predict the sites of the most effective solvation or the charge distribution of the optimal catalyst for a given reaction.",

	abstract = "Hybrid QM/MM methods combine the rigor of quantum mechanical (QM) calculations with the low computational cost of empirical molecular mechanical (MM) treatment allowing to capture dynamic properties to probe critical atomistic details of enzyme reactions. Catalysis by RNA enzymes (ribozymes) has only recently begun to be addressed with QM/MM approaches and is thus still a ﬁeld under development. This review surveys methodology as well as recent advances in QM/MM applications to RNA mechanisms, including those of the HDV, hairpin, and hammerhead ribozymes, as well as the ribosome. We compare and correlate QM/MM results with those from QM and/or molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and discuss scope and limitations with a critical eye on current shortcomings in available methodologies and computer resources. We thus hope to foster mutual appreciation and facilitate collaboration between experimentalists and theorists to jointly advance our understanding of RNA catalysis at an atomistic level.",
