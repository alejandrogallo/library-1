In the case of small nanoparticles, for which particle size is comparable to the dimension of the block copolymer (FAu/Rg ≈ 1), particles act like solutes that are dissolved within polystyrene-block-poly(acrylic acid) (PS-b-PAA) micelle cores. In the case of larger nanoparticles (FAu/Rg > 1), PS-b-PAA adsorption is templated by the particle surface, and a concentric core-shell structure is formed. The thickness of this shell can be predicted from theoretical models of polymer adsorption onto highly curved surfaces and controlled by varying the ratio of polymer to available nanoparticle surface area. We anticipate that these rules will illustrate how cross-linked copolymer shells with predetermined thickness can be used to stabilize and functionalize a variety of nanoparticle materials.",

Lamellar and cylindrical phases are observed in both systems but not at the corresponding relative copolymer tether block fractions. The effect of nanoparticle geometry on phase behavior is investigated by comparing the self-assembled structures formed by the tethered {NBBs} with those of their linear {ABC} triblock copolymer counterparts. The tethered nanocubes exhibit the conventional triblock copolymer lamellar and cylindrical phases when the repulsive interactions between different blocks are symmetric. The rigid and bulky nature of the cube induces interfacial curvature in the tethered {NBB} phases compared to their linear {ABC} triblock copolymer counterparts.

We ﬁnd that the electrostatic attraction improves the adhesion of a charged nanoparticle to the membrane. With the increase of electrostatic energy, a charged NP can be almost fully wrapped by the membrane. In addition, analyses of structural variations suggest that the adhesion of a charged NP induces a local transition in ﬂuid bilayers. Some thermodynamic quantities such as free energy, entropy, and enthalpy are also obtained to explain the process of NPs binding. Furthermore, the bending energy of wrapping of NPs against the electrostatic potential energy is also discussed based on the Helfrich theory, indicating that the driving force of the wrap originates from the gain in electrostatic energy at the cost of the elastic energy of biomembranes. Our observations shed light on the origin of experiments of the wrap as well as the mechanism of structural transitions of membranes due to the electrostatic binding.",

	abstract = "We propose a theory for the structure of the interphase in polymeric nanocomposites based on the freely-jointed chain near an impermeable spherical inclusion. The theory considers only the entropic exclusion between a polymer and the inclusion. The radius of gyration of the polymer chain and its distortion from spherical symmetry are perturbed strongly when the chain end is closer than 3Rg0 from the surface of the sphere, where Rg0 is the unperturbed radius of gyration. Also, the maximum expansion of the chain is bounded by (4/3)½, equal to a 15\% increase. The shape of the polymer chain is elongated tangentially to the surface when the chain end originates in the interphase, but elongates radially due to entropic repulsion when the chain end is very close to the surface of the sphere. All the distortions of the polymer conformation from ideality, and hence the spatial extent of the interphase, occur within the depletion region associated with colloids. The model is used to explain recent experimental results showing that polymer chain dimensions increase in the presence of nanoparticles. The model quantitatively reproduces the observations at low ﬁller loadings using no adjustable parameters, suggesting that entropic arguments can describe the majority of the effect there.",

	abstract = "Functionalizing nanoparticles with organic ligands, such as oligomers, polymers, DNA, and proteins, is an attractive way to manipulate the interfacial interactions between the nanoparticles and the medium the particles are placed in, and thus control the nanoparticle assembly. In this paper we have conducted a Monte Carlo simulation study on copolymer grafted spherical nanoparticles to show the tremendous potential of using monomer sequence on the copolymers to tune the grafted chain conformation, and thus the effective interactions between copolymer grafted nanoparticles. We have studied AB copolymers with alternating, multiblock, or diblock sequences, where either A monomers or B monomers have monomer-monomer attractive interactions. Our focus has been to show the nontrivial effect of monomer sequence on the conformations of the grafted copolymers at various particle diameters, grafting densities, copolymer chain lengths, and monomer-monomer interactions in an implicit small molecule solvent. We observe that the monomer sequence, particle diameter, and grafting density dictate whether a the grafted chains aggregate to bring attractive monomers from multiple grafted chains together interchain and intrachain monomer aggregation if the enthalpy gained by doing so offsets the entropic loss caused by stretching of chains, or b each grafted chain folds onto itself to bring its attractive monomers together only intrachain monomer aggregation if the entropic loss from interchain aggregation cannot be overcome by the enthalpic gain. For six copolymers of chain length N = 24 grafted on a spherical particle of diameter D = 4, interchain and intrachain monomer aggregation occurs, and the radius of gyration varies nonmonotonically with increasing blockiness of the monomer sequence. At larger particle diameters the grafted chains transition to purely intrachain monomer aggregation. The radius of gyration varies monotonically with monomer sequence for intrachain monomer aggregation because as the sequence becomes blockier like monomers are grouped together , the copolymer chain has to fold less compactly to maximize the enthalpically favorable contacts while maintaining high conformational entropy. The radius of gyration of alternating and diblock copolymers scales with chain length N through a power law Rg2 1/2 = N with the prefactor and scaling exponent, varying with monomer sequence and monomer-monomer attraction strength.",

We investigate how the nanoparticle afﬁnity can be affected by changing the binding energy, the percent of functionalization by ligands, tether length, grafting density, and nanoparticle core size. In general, using a longer tether length or increasing the number of tethered chains without increasing the number of ligands increases the conformational penalty for tether stretching/compression near the cell surface and leads to a decrease in targeting efﬁciency. At the same time, using longer tethers or a larger core size allows ligands to interact with receptors over a larger cell surface area, which can enhance the nanoparticle afﬁnity toward the cell surface. We also discuss the selectivity of nanoparticle targeting of cells with a high receptor density. Based on the obtained results, we provide recommendations for improving the nanoparticle binding afﬁnity and selectivity, which can guide future nanoparticle development for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.",
